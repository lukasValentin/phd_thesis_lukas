              Crop diversification is a potential strategy to increase the stability and productivity of crops, while reducing pathogen pressures and pesticide requirements. Crop variety mixtures provide some of these diversification benefits and their cultivation is fully compatible with current mechanized agronomic practices. However, the development of optimal variety mixtures is a long, labour‐intense process requiring extensive field trials. High throughput field phenotyping (HTFP) methods provide promising applications in field testing because they allow for precise, repeatable, and rapid measurements of crop properties. Here, we evaluated the use of HTFP for developing high‐performing oat ( 
              Avena sativa 
              ) variety mixtures by testing its suitability to predict diversity yield benefits from repeated canopy measurements across the growing season. Analyzing 26 mixtures of five varieties, we found significant overyielding at harvest, that is, mixtures were on average more productive than expected based on component pure stands. This grain yield overyielding was well predicted from deviations between mixture and pure stand canopy cover estimations, derived from HTFP mid‐way through the growing season. This shows that (i) positive interactions between oat varieties occur already at an early stage, (ii) such interactions lead to increased potential for light interception, (iii) HTFP offers rapid, scalable methods to screen for performant variety mixtures.

              Future food security will depend on crop adaptation to changing environments. We studied the limitations imposed by daylength, temperature and solar radiation on wheat yield in eight field experiments conducted at contrasting northern latitudes and involving 42 adapted spring durum wheat genotypes of divergent phenology, and reduced or without photoperiod sensitivity. Air temperatures averaged from sowing to anthesis ( 
              SA 
              ) increased from northern to southern sites, while daylength and minimum temperatures from anthesis to maturity (grain filling, 
              GF 
              ) followed the opposite trend, due to differences in the latitude of sites. The site effect explained 96 \% of the variation in the number of days 
              SA 
              , which was much smaller in southern sites. Average minimum daily temperatures above 6.9 °C before anthesis and below 10.8 °C during

              accompanied by photoperiods during

	abstract = {The Richards function is often inappropriate to describe growth for crop stands, in which dry matter characteristically increases at an almost constant rate during the main growth stage. An alternative function with a more physiological basis is developed by assuming that, when light is limiting, growth rate is proportional to intercepted radiation and therefore to an exponential function of leaf area. As the function describes the transition from exponential to linear growth, the name expolinear growth equation is proposed. The parameters of the equation are an initial maximum relative growth rate Rm, a maximum absolute growth rate Cm, and a time tb at which the stand effectively passes from exponential to linear growth. The ratio Rm/Cm is the product of a light attenuation coefficient K, a specific leaf area s, and a ratio of leaf weight to total plant weight p1. The time tb ‘lost’ for growth while the canopy is closing is proportional to the logarithm of fractional light interception at emergence and inversely proportional to Rm. Termination of growth is accounted for by truncation of the expolinear equation.Applications of this type of analysis are given for sorghum and faba bean. The descriptive power of the equation is illustrated for oil palm. Implications for optimum growth strategies are reviewed and caveats are entered.},

Neither approach is new, but a combination is suggested that eliminates the parameter measured with most difficulty—surface temperature—and provides for the first time an opportunity to make theoretical estimates of evaporation rates from standard meteorological data, estimates that can be retrospective. Experimental work to test these theories shows that the aerodynamic approach is not adequate and an empirical expression, previously obtained in America, is a better description of evaporation from open water. The energy balance is found to be quite successful. Evaporation rates from wet bare soil and from turf with an adequate supply of water are obtained as fractions of that from open water, the fraction for turf showing a seasonal change attributed to the annual cycle of length of daylight. Finally, the experimental results are applied to data published elsewhere and it is shown that a satisfactory account can be given of open water evaporation at four widely spaced sites in America and Europe, the results for bare soil receive a reasonable check in India, and application of the results for turf shows good agreement with estimates of evaporation from catchment areas in the British Isles.},

            Quantifying changes in hot temperature extremes is key for developing adaptation strategies. Changes in hot extremes are often determined on the basis of air temperatures; however, hydrology and many biogeochemical processes are more sensitive to soil temperature. Here we show that soil hot extremes are increasing faster than air hot extremes by 0.7 °C per decade in intensity and twice as fast in frequency on average over Central Europe. Furthermore, we identify soil temperature as a key factor in the soil moisture–temperature feedback. During dry and warm conditions, the energy absorbed by the soil is used to warm the soil, increasing the release of sensible heat flux and surface air temperatures. This increase in surface air temperature leads to a higher atmospheric demand for water, increasing soil evaporation, which may further dry and warm the soil highlighting the contribution of soil moisture–temperature feedback to the evolution of hot extremes in a warming climate.},

              Understanding the drivers of yield levels under climate change is required to support adaptation planning and respond to changing production risks. This study uses an ensemble of crop models applied on a spatial grid to quantify the contributions of various climatic drivers to past yield variability in grain maize and winter wheat of European cropping systems (1984–2009) and drivers of climate change impacts to 2050. Results reveal that for the current genotypes and mix of irrigated and rainfed production, climate change would lead to yield losses for grain maize and gains for winter wheat. Across Europe, on average heat stress does not increase for either crop in rainfed systems, while drought stress intensifies for maize only. In low-yielding years, drought stress persists as the main driver of losses for both crops, with elevated CO

	abstract = {The efficiency of crop production is defined in thermodynamic terms as the ratio of energy output (carbohydrate) to energy input (solar radiation). Temperature and water supply are the main climatic constraints on efficiency. Over most of Britain, the radiation and thermal climates are uniform and rainfall is the main discriminant of yield between regions. Total production of dry matter by barley, potatoes, sugar beet, and apples is strongly correlated with intercepted radiation and these crops form carbohydrate at about 1.4 g per MJ solar energy, equivalent to 2.4\% efficiency. Crop growth in Britain may therefore be analysed in terms of ( 
              a 
              ) the amount of light intercepted during the growing season and ( 
              b 
              ) the efficiency with which intercepted light is used. The amount intercepted depends on the seasonal distribution of leaf area which, in turn, depends on temperature and soil water supply. These variables are discussed in terms of the rate and duration of development phases. A factorial analysis of efficiency shows that the major arable crops in Britain intercept only about 40 \% of annual solar radiation and their efficiency for supplying energy through economic yield is only about 0.3\%. Some of the factors responsible for this figure are well understood and some are immutable. More work is needed to identify the factors responsible for the large differences between average commercial and record yields.},

              Due to many factors in the physical properties of the ground surface, the corresponding interferometric coherence values change dynamically over time. Among these factors, the roles of the vegetation and its temporal variation have not yet been revealed so far. In this paper, synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1) data and optical remote sensing (Landsat TM) images over four whole seasons are employed to reveal the relationship between the interferometric coherence and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at five sites that have ground deformation due to mining in Henan province, China. The result showed: (1) As for the village area with few vegetation cover, the related coherence values are significantly higher than that in the farm land area with high densities of vegetation in the spring and summer, which indicates that the subsidence by mining in few vegetation cover area is easier to be monitored; (2) Linear regression coefficients (

              ) between the interfereometric coherence values and the NDVI values is 0.62, which indicate the interferometric coherence values and the NDVI values change reversely in both farm land and village areas over the year. It suggests months between November and March with lower NDVI value are more suitable for deformation detecting. Therefore, the interfereometric coherence values can be used to detect the density of vegetation, while NDVI values can be reference for elucidating when the traditional differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) could be effectively used.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13081589},
	abstract = {In support of cropland monitoring, operational Copernicus Sentinel-2 (S2) data became available globally and can be explored for the retrieval of important crop traits. Based on a hybrid workﬂow, retrieval models for six essential biochemical and biophysical crop traits were developed for both S2 bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) L2A and S2 top-of-atmosphere (TOA) L1C data. A variational heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression (VHGPR) algorithm was trained with simulations generated by the combined leaf-canopy reﬂectance model PROSAILat the BOA scale and further combined with the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6SV) atmosphere model at the TOA scale. Established VHGPR models were then applied to S2 L1C and L2A reﬂectance data for mapping: leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), leaf water content (Cw), fractional vegetation coverage (FVC), leaf area index (LAI), and upscaled leaf biochemical compounds, i.e., LAI ∗ Cab (laiCab) and LAI ∗ Cw (laiCw). Estimated variables were validated using in situ reference data collected during the Munich-North-Isar ﬁeld campaigns within growing seasons of maize and winter wheat in the years 2017 and 2018. For leaf biochemicals, retrieval from BOA reﬂectance slightly outperformed results from TOA reﬂectance, e.g., obtaining a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.5 µg/cm2 (BOA) vs. 8 µg/cm2 (TOA) in the case of Cab. For the majority of canopy-level variables, instead, estimation accuracy was higher when using TOA reﬂectance data, e.g., with an RMSE of 139 g/m2 (BOA) vs. 113 g/m2 (TOA) for laiCw. Derived maps were further compared against reference products obtained from the ESA Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) Biophysical Processor. Altogether, the consistency between L1C and L2A retrievals conﬁrmed that crop traits can potentially be estimated directly from TOA reﬂectance data. Successful mapping of canopy-level crop traits including information about prediction conﬁdence suggests that the models can be transferred over spatial and temporal scales and, therefore, can contribute to decision-making processes for cropland management.},

In this overview, we outline the development of plant phenotyping as a multidisciplinary field. We sketch the technological advancement that laid the foundation for the development of phenotyping centers and evaluate the upcoming challenges for further advancement of plant phenotyping specifically with respect to standardization of data acquisition and reusability.

              . The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) is a lidar mission launched by NASA to the International Space Station in 2018. GEDI was specifically designed to retrieve vegetation structure within a novel, theoretical sampling design that explicitly quantifies biomass and its uncertainty across a variety of spatial scales. In this paper we provide the estimates of pan-tropical and temperate biomass derived from two years of GEDI observations. We present estimates of mean biomass densities at 1 km resolution, as well as estimates aggregated to the national level for every country GEDI observes, and at the sub-national level for the United States. For all estimates we provide the standard error of the mean biomass. These data serve as a baseline for current biomass stocks and their future changes, and the mission’s integrated use of formal statistical inference points the way towards the possibility of a new generation of powerful monitoring tools from space.},

The recent rapid development of sensors, image-processing technology, and data-analysis has provided opportunities for multiple scales phenotyping methods and systems, including satellite imagery. Among these platforms, satellite imagery may represent one of the ultimate approaches to remotely monitor trials and nurseries planted in multiple locations while standardizing protocols and reducing costs. However, the deployment of satellite-based phenotyping in breeding trials has largely been limited by low spatial resolution of satellite images. The advent of a new generation of high-resolution satellites may finally overcome these limitations. The SkySat constellation started offering multispectral images at a 0.5 m resolution since 2020. In this communication we present a case study on the use of time series SkySat images to estimate NDVI from wheat and maize breeding plots encompassing different sizes and spacing. We evaluated the reliability of the calculated NDVI and tested its capacity to detect seasonal changes and genotypic differences. We discuss the advantages, limitations, and perspectives of this approach for high-throughput phenotyping in breeding programs.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is one of the key nutrients supplied in agricultural production worldwide. Over-fertilization can have negative influences on the field and the regional level (e.g., agro-ecosystems). Remote sensing of the plant N of field crops presents a valuable tool for the monitoring of N flows in agro-ecosystems. Available data for validation of satellite-based remote sensing of N is scarce. Therefore, in this study, field spectrometer measurements were used to simulate data of the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites developed for vegetation monitoring by the ESA. The prediction performance of normalized ratio indices (NRIs), random forest regression (RFR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR) for plant-N-related traits was assessed on a diverse real-world dataset including multiple crops, field sites and years. The plant N traits included the mass-based N measure, N concentration in the biomass (Nconc), and an area-based N measure approximating the plant N uptake (NUP). Spectral indices such as normalized ratio indices (NRIs) performed well, but the RFR and GPR methods outperformed the NRIs. Key spectral bands for each trait were identified using the RFR variable importance measure and the Gaussian processes regression band analysis tool (GPR-BAT), highlighting the importance of the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region for estimation of plant Nconc—and to a lesser extent the NUP. The red edge (RE) region was also important. The GPR-BAT showed that five bands were sufficient for plant N trait and leaf area index (LAI) estimation and that a surplus of bands effectively reduced prediction performance. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was performed on all traits simultaneously, showing the dominance of the LAI in the mixed remote sensing signal. To delineate the plant-N-related traits from this signal, regional and/or national data collection campaigns producing large crop spectral libraries (CSL) are needed. An improved database will likely enable the mapping of N at the agro-ecosystem level or for use in precision farming by farmers in the future.},

	abstract = {Accurate and efficient phenotyping has become the biggest hurdle for evaluating large populations in plant breeding and genetics. Contrary to genotyping, high‐throughput approaches to field‐based phenotyping have not been realized and fully implemented. To address this bottleneck, a novel, low‐cost, flexible phenotyping platform, named Phenocart, was developed and tested on a field trial consisting of 10 historical and current elite wheat ( 
              Triticum aestivium 
              L.) breeding lines at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). The lines were cultivated during the 2013 and 2014 growing cycle in Ciudad Obregon, Mexico, and evaluated multiple times throughout the growing season. The phenotyping platform was developed by integrating several sensors: a GreenSeeker for spectral reflectance, an infrared thermometer (IRT), and a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver into one functional unit. The Phenocart enabled simultaneous collection of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and canopy temperature (CT) with precise assignment of all measurements to plot location by georeferenced data points. Across the set of varieties, the Phenocart temperature measurements were highly correlated to a handheld IRT. In addition, CT and NDVI were both significantly correlated to yield throughout the growing season. The Phenocart is a flexible, low‐cost, and easily deployable platform to increase the amount of phenotypic data that crop breeders obtain as well as provide high‐resolution phenotypic data for genetic discovery.},

            Photosynthesis acclimates quickly to the fluctuating environment in order to optimize the absorption of sunlight energy, specifically the photosynthetic photon fluence rate (PPFR), to fuel plant growth. The conversion efficiency of intercepted PPFR to photochemical energy (ɛe) and to biomass (ɛc) are critical parameters to describe plant productivity over time. However, they mask the link of instantaneous photochemical energy uptake under specific conditions, that is, the operating efficiency of photosystem II (Fq′/Fm′), and biomass accumulation. Therefore, the identification of energy- and thus resource-efficient genotypes under changing environmental conditions is impeded. We long-term monitored Fq′/Fm′ at the canopy level for 21 soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and maize (Zea mays) genotypes under greenhouse and field conditions using automated chlorophyll fluorescence and spectral scans. Fq′/Fm′ derived under incident sunlight during the entire growing season was modeled based on genotypic interactions with different environmental variables. This allowed us to cumulate the photochemical energy uptake and thus estimate ɛe noninvasively. ɛe ranged from 48\% to 62\%, depending on the genotype, and up to 9\% of photochemical energy was transduced into biomass in the most efficient C4 maize genotype. Most strikingly, ɛe correlated with shoot biomass in seven independent experiments under varying conditions with up to r = 0.68. Thus, we estimated biomass production by integrating photosynthetic response to environmental stresses over the growing season and identified energy-efficient genotypes. This has great potential to improve crop growth models and to estimate the productivity of breeding lines or whole ecosystems at any time point using autonomous measuring systems.},

              The possible interacting effects of shading and N supply on number of grains of 
              Triticum aestivum 
              L. (cv. Buck Ñandú) were investigated at Balcarce, Argentina, during the 1988/89 and 1989/90 growing seasons. Shading was imposed from 
              c. 
              13 days before anthesis to 6 days after, and four rates of N fertilization were supplied within each shading treatment around the date of terminal spikelet formation. Water and other nutrients were not limiting. 
             
             
              Total grain yield was strongly correlated with grain number/m 
              2 
              , regardless of shading or N supply. At the highest N rates, grain number and dry weight of spikes at anthesis were linearly related to a photothermal quotient, i.e. the ratio of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to mean temperature minus 4·5 °C, during the period from 20 days before anthesis to 10 days after. The response of grain number to the photothermal quotient was interpreted in terms of the supply of assimilates to the spike at anthesis, which determined flower survival. The response of dry weight of spikes to photothermal quotient was interpreted in terms of crop growth rate since there was a linear relationship between crop growth rate and intercepted radiation. The lowest N rates reduced the number of grains/m 
              2 
              , at any given photothermal quotient. Since the reduction in grain number also occurred at any given dry weight of spikes, it cannot be explained by a reduced supply of assimilates to the spikes. Grain number responded directly to the supply of N to the spike, probably through the survival of differentiated flowers. The relationship between spike growth rate and crop growth rate was not affected by N supply. Crop growth rate was reduced by reduced N supply, because less radiation was intercepted and because radiation-use efficiency was lowered. These results indicate that current models for determining yield and number of grains/m 
              2 
              , based on crop growth, are not adequate when N is deficient.},

            Large agricultural field trials may display irregular spatial trends that cannot be fully captured by a purely randomization‐based analysis. For this reason, paralleling the development of analysis‐of‐variance procedures for randomized field trials, there is a long history of spatial modeling for field trials, starting with the early work of Papadakis on nearest neighbor analysis, which can be cast in terms of first or second differences among neighboring plot values. This kind of spatial modeling is amenable to a natural extension using splines, as has been demonstrated in recent publications in the field. Here, we consider the P‐spline framework, focusing on model options that are easy to implement in linear mixed model packages. Two examples serve to illustrate and evaluate the methods. A key conclusion is that first differences are rather competitive with second differences. A further key observation is that second differences require special attention regarding the representation of the null space of the smooth terms for spatial interaction, and that an unstructured variance–covariance structure is required to ensure invariance to translation and rotation of eigenvectors associated with that null space. We develop a strategy that permits fitting this model with ease, but the approach is more demanding than that needed for fitting models using first differences. Hence, even though in other areas, second differences are very commonly used in the application of P‐splines, our conclusion is that with field trials, first differences have advantages for routine use.},

            Harvest index values were studied in cereals during 1964 to 1967. A high degree of variability was found in the harvest index of winter wheat and other cereals. Stems contributed the greatest amount of dry weight to the straw yield and thus, as a vegetative part, materially influenced the harvest index. Reduction in plant height had the greatest effect on the stem dry weight and least on grain yield. Reduction in plant height lowered the dry weight of the vegetative parts and thereby lowered the straw yield which resulted in an increased harvest index. Harvest index was positively correlated with grain yield but negatively correlated with vegetative growth.},

	abstract = {This review focuses on recent advances in some key areas of wheat physiology, namely phasic development, determination of potential yield and water-limited potential yield, tolerance to some other abiotic stresses (aluminium, salt, heat shock), and simulation modelling. Applications of the new knowledge to breeding and crop agronomy are emphasized. The linking of relatively simple traits like time to flowering, and aluminium and salt tolerance, in each case to a small number of genes, is being greatly facilitated by the development of molecular gene markers, and there is some progress on the functional basis of these links, and likely application in breeding. However with more complex crop features like potential yield, progress at the gene level is negligible, and even that at the level of the physiology of seemingly important component traits (e.g., grain number, grain weight, soil water extraction, sensitivity to water shortage at meiosis) is patchy and generally slow although a few more heritable traits (e.g. carbon isotope discrimination, coleoptile length) are seeing application. This is despite the advent of smart tools for molecular analysis and for phenotyping, and the move to study genetic variation in soundly-constituted populations. Exploring the functional genomics of traits has a poor record of application; while trait validation in breeding appears underinvested. Simulation modeling is helping to unravel G × E interaction for yield, and is beginning to explore genetic variation in traits in this context, but adequate validation is often lacking. Simulation modelling to project agronomic options over time is, however, more successful, and has become an essential tool, probably because less uncertainty surrounds the influence of variable water and climate on the performance of a given cultivar. It is the ever-increasing complexity we are seeing with genetic variation which remains the greatest challenge for modelling, molecular biology, and indeed physiology, as they all seek to progress yield at a rate greater than empirical breeding is achieving.},

	abstract = {A dwarf spring wheat (Triticum aestivum ‘Yecora 70’) was grown under irrigation and optimal agronomy in northwest Mexico during four winter seasons. Single shading treatments of approximately four (1971, 1972), three (1973), and two (1974) weeks duration and various intensities were used to elucidate the importance for grain yield of radiation and crop photosynthesis at different stages of development. 
            Shading always reduced crop growth, approximately in direct proportion to the reduction in radiation. Grain yield reduction was however curvilinearly related to radiation such that small reductions had little effect on yield at any developmental stage. Yield reductions with heavier shading only occurred with shading after about 60 days after seeding and were greater before anthesis (90 days) than after anthesis, especially in 1973. 
             
              The shorter shading treatments indicated that the period of rapid spike growth, approximately 35 to 5 days before anthesis, was that showing greatest sensitivity to shading. Shading then led to fewer spikes/m 
              2 
              (lower tiller survival) and fewer grains/splkelet (fewer florets produced), hence reduced grains/m 
              2 
             
             
              Responses to post‐anthesis shading suggest that the degree of yield limitation by post‐anthesis photosynthesis is not constant for a given genotype, varying substantially from year to year. Thus in 1973 immediate pre‐anthesis conditions were unfavorable due to cloudiness, grains/m 
              2 
              was low, and yield was entirely limited by this factor. In other years, yield was more sensitive to post‐anthesis shading. However it is concluded that grains/m 
              2 
              , hence crop photosynthesis in the immediate pre‐anthesis period, is the key to higher yield in this cultivar.},

	abstract = {Climate change challenges efforts to maintain and improve crop production in many regions. In this Review, we examine yield responses to warmer temperatures, elevated carbon dioxide and changes in water availability for globally important staple cereal crops (wheat, maize, millet, sorghum and rice). Elevated CO2 can have a compensatory effect on crop yield for C3 crops (wheat and rice), but it can be offset by heat and drought. In contrast, elevated CO2 only benefits C4 plants (maize, millet and sorghum) under drought stress. Under the most severe climate change scenario and without adaptation, simulated crop yield losses range from 7\% to 23\%. The adverse effects in higher latitudes could potentially be offset or reversed by CO2 fertilization and adaptation options, but lower latitudes, where C4 crops are the primary crops, benefit less from CO2 fertilization. Irrigation and nutrient management are likely to be the most effective adaptation options (up to 40\% in wheat yield for higher latitudes compared with baseline) but require substantial investments and might not be universally applicable, for example where there are water resource constraints. Establishing multifactor experiments (including multipurpose cultivar panels), developing biotic stress modelling routines, merging process-based and data-driven models, and using integrated impact assessments, are all essential to better capture and assess yield responses to climate change.},

            Plant phenology, the annually recurring sequence of plant developmental stages, is important for plant functioning and ecosystem services and their biophysical and biogeochemical feedbacks to the climate system. Plant phenology depends on temperature, and the current rapid climate change has revived interest in understanding and modeling the responses of plant phenology to the warming trend and the consequences thereof for ecosystems. Here, we review recent progresses in plant phenology and its interactions with climate change. Focusing on the start (leaf unfolding) and end (leaf coloring) of plant growing seasons, we show that the recent rapid expansion in ground‐ and remote sensing‐ based phenology data acquisition has been highly beneficial and has supported major advances in plant phenology research. Studies using multiple data sources and methods generally agree on the trends of advanced leaf unfolding and delayed leaf coloring due to climate change, yet these trends appear to have decelerated or even reversed in recent years. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the plant phenology responses to climate warming is still limited. The interactions between multiple drivers complicate the modeling and prediction of plant phenology changes. Furthermore, changes in plant phenology have important implications for ecosystem carbon cycles and ecosystem feedbacks to climate, yet the quantification of such impacts remains challenging. We suggest that future studies should primarily focus on using new observation tools to improve the understanding of tropical plant phenology, on improving process‐based phenology modeling, and on the scaling of phenology from species to landscape‐level.},

	abstract = {For thousands of years, agriculture and tillage were considered synonymous. It was simply not thought possible to grow crops without first tilling the soil before planting and for weed control. The advent of modern herbicides permitted no‐tillage (NT) to be developed and practiced on actual working family farms. No‐tillage is generally defined as planting crops in unprepared soil with at least 30\% mulch cover. Adoption of NT after its successful demonstration in the 1950s was slow. However, with better planters, herbicides, and accumulated experience, NT began to be widely adopted in the 1980s in the United States and then in Australia, South America, and Canada. Today, approximately 23\% of the total cropland in the United States is planted using NT. No‐tillage has revolutionized agricultural systems because it allows individual producers to manage greater amounts of land with reduced energy, labor, and machinery inputs. At the same time, NT is a very effective erosion control measure and improves water and fertilizer use efficiency so that many crops yield better under NT than under tilled systems. Tillage, like crops, can be rotated but the benefits of NT are most likely to be realized with continuous application. We review some of the early work that led to the development of NT and how NT impacts the crop, soil, hydrology, and farm economics. While highly sustainable, there are still many challenges that remain for researchers to solve so the benefits of NT can be realized on expanded land area and for more crops, worldwide.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT
Crop diversification has been proposed as a promising strategy for transitioning towards sustainable agricultural systems by leveraging biological processes and controls present in naturally biodiverse ecosystems. Strip cropping, a form of intercropping where two or more crops are grown adjacent to one another in long and narrow multi-row strips, has been shown to deliver a greater range of ecosystem services compared to sole crop references due to increased interspecific crop interactions, spatio-temporal niche differentiation, and higher in-field habitat diversity. The possibility to adjust the strip width to the working width of farmers' existing machines gives strip cropping of cash crops an important implementation advantage over other intercropping practices. Systematic exploration and evaluation of spatial plans for strip cropping systems, however, is constrained by the lack of spatially-explicit design approaches.
OBJECTIVE
Here we present a framework to support systematic exploration of spatio-temporal strip cropping configurations for a given farm context and set of objectives.
METHODS
The framework comprises six steps: 1) Diagnosis of the current farm situation; 2) Specification of strip cropping system attributes; 3) Temporal strip cropping planning; 4) Spatio-temporal strip cropping planning; 5) Spatio-temporal strip cropping configuration assessment; 6) Strip cropping configuration selection and visualization. We combine two software applications: ROTAT to generate crop rotations and the novel RotaStrip to systematically explore spatio-temporal configurations based on the rotations generated by ROTAT. We illustrate the framework with a case study from the Netherlands using gross margin, habitat score, and spatial crop compatibility score as indicators.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
150 crop rotations were generated. When 6 additional crops were included this was increased to 51,371, and the maximum values of the three indicator scores were also improved. Using the thirteen candidate crops to generate spatio-temporal configurations, we identified 16 Pareto-optimal and 78 anti-optimal configurations, from which the highest and lowest performing configurations were selected. The two contrasting configurations scored 7254 and 6658 €.ha−1.yr−1 for gross margin, 0.88 and 0.75 for habitat score, and 98 and− 58 for crop compatibility score, respectively, illustrating the value of consideration of the spatial aspects. Bridging the current knowledge gaps regarding what constitute good crop combinations, and strengthening the evidence underpinning the evaluation of ecosystem service delivery on the basis of spatial configuration, would further improve the quality of the generated strip cropping plans.
SIGNIFICANCE
The framework presented and illustrated in this study provides a basis for systematic spatio-temporal strip cropping systems design and implementation.},

At present, large farms in developed countries are the main adopters of precision farming. But its potential environmental benefits can justify greater public and private sector incentives to encourage adoption, including in small-scale farming systems in developing countries. Technological developments and big data advances continue to make precision farming tools more connected, accurate, efficient, and widely applicable.

	abstract = {Increasing land-use intensity is a main driver of biodiversity loss in farmland, but measuring proxies for land-use intensity across entire landscapes is challenging. Here, we develop a novel method for the assessment of the impact of land-use intensity on biodiversity in agricultural landscapes using remote sensing parameters derived from the Sentinel-2 satellites. We link crop phenology and productivity parameters derived from time-series of a two-band enhanced vegetation index with biodiversity indicators (insect pollinators and insect-pollinated vascular plants) in agricultural fields in southern Sweden, with contrasting land management (i.e. conventional and organic farming). Our results show that arable land-use intensity in cereal systems dominated by spring-sown cereals can be approximated using Sentinel-2 productivity parameters. This was shown by the significant positive correlations between the amplitude and maximum value of the enhanced vegetation index on one side and farmer reported yields on the other. We also found that conventional cereal fields had 17\% higher maximum and 13\% higher amplitude of their enhanced vegetation index than organic fields. Sentinel-2 derived parameters were more strongly correlated with the abundance and species richness of bumblebees and the richness of vascular plants than the abundance and species richness of butterflies. The relationships we found between biodiversity and crop production proxies are consistent with predictions that increasing agricultural land-use intensity decreases field biodiversity. The newly developed method based on crop phenology and productivity parameters derived from Sentinel-2 data serves as a proof of concept for the assessment of the impact of land-use intensity on biodiversity over cereal fields across larger areas. It enables the estimation of arable productivity in cereal systems, which can then be used by ecologists and develop tools for land managers as a proxy for land-use intensity. Coupled with spatially explicit databases on agricultural land-use, this method will enable crop-specific cereal productivity estimation across large geographical regions.},

This requires the further expansion of modern agriculture, but modern agriculture rests on a small number of highly productive crops and its expansion has led to a significant loss of global biodiversity. Ecologists have shown that biodiversity loss results in lower plant productivity, while agricultural economists have linked biodiversity loss on farms with increasing variability of crop yields, and sometimes lower mean yields. In this paper we consider the macro-economic consequences of the continued expansion of particular forms of intensive, modern agriculture, with a focus on how the loss of biodiversity affects food production. We employ a quantitative, structurally estimated model of the global economy, which jointly determines economic growth, population and food demand, agricultural innovations and land conversion. We show that even small effects of agricultural expansion on productivity via biodiversity loss might be sufficient to warrant a moratorium on further land conversion.},

The 2012 drought, one of the worst during the last 80 years or more, reminds us of the dust bowl of the 1930s (figure 1) and indicates that climate change is a reality rather than a distant threat. The drought has had a severe impact on yields, reducing the predicted grain production for corn per acre at a farm level to levels of production that have not been seen since 1995 and severely impacting other crops such as soybeans. Analysis has predicted that these lower yields will contribute to spikes in wholesale prices for consumers in the United States and internationally since the United States is the world's leading exporter of these grains. It is projected that prices for meat, eggs, and milk will also increase as a result of the drought impacts on grain yields, animals, and forages among other factors.
Many view the 2012 drought as an extension of the exceptional drought of 2011 in Texas and surrounding regions, during which 7.5 million ac (3 million ha) succumbed to wildfire in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Additionally, many expect that these droughts will be the new norm during this century. These droughts are following recent droughts like the…},

Over the past decades, efforts have been made to assess drought risk at different spatial scales. Here, we present for the first time an integrated assessment of drought risk for both irrigated and rainfed agricultural systems at the global scale. Composite hazard indicators were calculated for irrigated and rainfed systems separately using different drought indices based on historical climate conditions (1980–2016). Exposure was analyzed for irrigated and non-irrigated crops. Vulnerability was assessed through a socioecological-system (SES) perspective, using socioecological susceptibility and lack of coping-capacity indicators that were weighted by drought experts from around the world. The analysis shows that drought risk of rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems displays a heterogeneous pattern at the global level, with higher risk for southeastern Europe as well as northern and southern Africa. By providing information on the drivers and spatial patterns of drought risk in all dimensions of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, the presented analysis can support the identification of tailored measures to reduce drought risk and increase the resilience of agricultural systems.},

            Water scarcity raises major concerns on the sustainable future of humanity and the conservation of important ecosystem functions. To meet the increasing food demand without expanding cultivated areas, agriculture will likely need to introduce irrigation in croplands that are currently rain-fed but where enough water would be available for irrigation. “Agricultural economic water scarcity” is, here, defined as lack of irrigation due to limited institutional and economic capacity instead of hydrologic constraints. To date, the location and productivity potential of economically water scarce croplands remain unknown. We develop a monthly agrohydrological analysis to map agricultural regions affected by agricultural economic water scarcity. We find these regions account for up to 25\% of the global croplands, mostly across Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia. Sustainable irrigation of economically water scarce croplands could feed an additional 840 million people while preventing further aggravation of blue water scarcity.},

Here, we find that, while over the years the government support has incentivized the development of high-emission farming systems, at present, the support only has a small impact in terms of inducing additional global GHG emissions from agricultural production; partly because support is not systematically biased towards high-emission products, and partly because support generated by trade protection reduces demand for some high-emission products by raising their consumer prices.

The effects of climate change are a further threat. But the world can produce more food and can ensure that it is used more efficiently and equitably. A multifaceted and linked global strategy is needed to ensure sustainable and equitable food security, different components of which are explored here.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. Anthropogenic pressures on the Earth System have reached a scale where abrupt global environmental change can no longer be excluded. We propose a new approach to global sustainability in which we define planetary boundaries within which we expect that humanity can operate safely. Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. We have identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing upon current scientific understanding, we propose quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO₂ concentration in the atmosphere {\textless}350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W m−2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80\% of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone ({\textless}5\% reduction in O₃ concentration from pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N₂ to 35 Tg N yr−1) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use ({\textless}4000 km³ yr−1 of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change ({\textless}15\% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of {\textless}10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which we have not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading. We estimate that humanity has already transgressed three planetary boundaries: for climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, and changes to the global nitrogen cycle. Planetary boundaries are interdependent, because transgressing one may both shift the position of other boundaries or cause them to be transgressed. The social impacts of transgressing boundaries will be a function of the social–ecological resilience of the affected societies. Our proposed boundaries are rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps. Filling these gaps will require major advancements in Earth System and resilience science. The proposed concept of “planetary boundaries” lays the groundwork for shifting our approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative externalities, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the “planetary playing field” for humanity if we want to be sure of avoiding major human-induced environmental change on a global scale.},

Two planetary boundaries have been fully transgressed, i.e., are at high risk, biosphere integrity and biogeochemical flows, and agriculture has been the major driver of the transgression. Three are in a zone of uncertainty i.e., at increasing risk, with agriculture the major driver of two of those, landsystem change and freshwater use, and a significant contributor to the third, climate change. Agriculture is also a significant or major contributor to change for many of those planetary boundaries still in the safe zone. To reduce the role of agriculture in transgressing planetary boundaries, many interventions will be needed, including those in broader food systems.},

We estimate that land use change has affected almost a third (32\%) of the global land area in just six decades (1960-2019) and, thus, is around four times greater in extent than previously estimated from long-term land change assessments. We also identify geographically diverging land use change processes, with afforestation and cropland abandonment in the Global North and deforestation and agricultural expansion in the South. Here, we show that observed phases of accelerating ({\textasciitilde}1960–2005) and decelerating (2006–2019) land use change can be explained by the effects of global trade on agricultural production.},

We propose ESBs for maintaining the resilience and stability of the Earth system (safe ESBs) and minimizing exposure to significant harm to humans from Earth system change (a necessary but not sufficient condition for justice)4. The stricter of the safe or just boundaries sets the integrated safe and just ESB. Our findings show that justice considerations constrain the integrated ESBs more than safety considerations for climate and atmospheric aerosol loading. Seven of eight globally quantified safe and just ESBs and at least two regional safe and just ESBs in over half of global land area are already exceeded. We propose that our assessment provides a quantitative foundation for safeguarding the global commons for all people now and into the future.},

Ocean acidification is close to being breached, while aerosol loading regionally exceeds the boundary. Stratospheric ozone levels have slightly recovered. The transgression level has increased for all boundaries earlier identified as overstepped. As primary production drives Earth system biosphere functions, human appropriation of net primary production is proposed as a control variable for functional biosphere integrity. This boundary is also transgressed. Earth system modeling of different levels of the transgression of the climate and land system change boundaries illustrates that these anthropogenic impacts on Earth system must be considered in a systemic context.

The validation reveals good results for indices that are based on one or two climate variables only and on simple temporal aggregations. Indices that involve multiple climate variables, complex temporal statistics or extreme conditions are less well represented. The climate projection analysis indicates an intensification of temperature-related extreme events such as heat waves. In general, climate change signals in the indices considered are subject to three main patterns: a horizontal pattern across Switzerland, a vertical pattern depending on elevation and a temporal pattern with an intensification of change in the course of the 21st century. Changes are in most cases more pronounced for the high-emission RCP8.5 scenario compared to the mitigation scenario RCP2.6. Overall, the projections indicate a challenging 21st century climate for the agricultural sector. Our findings furthermore show the value and the necessity of a robust validation of climate scenario products to enable trustworthy and valuable impact analyses, especially for more complex indices and models.},

An experiment was conducted to investigate whether altering the duration of the stem elongation period in wheat and barley increases floret fertility and thereby grain number. A photoperiod-responsive spring wheat (UQ189) and spring barley (Arapiles) were grown in a naturally lit phytotron. Plants were grown at constant (9, 13 and 19 h) and reciprocally interchanged photoperiod [at terminal spikelet (TS, wheat) or triple mound (TM, barley)] to alter the duration of the stem elongation period. An increased duration of the late reproductive phase from TS to heading in wheat resulted in more fertile florets per spike. A similar relationship was observed in barley but only for a limited range of duration of the stem elongation period. Shorter photoperiods reduced the rate of floret development and extended the time to reach the fertile floret stage. The fact that the duration of the late reproductive phase during which the spike and stem competing for assimilates was associated with the number of fertile florets per spike suggests that extending the stem elongation period in cereals could be a way to reduce assimilate competition and thereby increase the number of fertile florets and grain yield.},

	abstract = {Stem elongation is a critical phase for yield formation in wheat (Triticum aestivum). This study proposes the use of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) for phenotyping of growth dynamics during wheat stem elongation in high temporal resolution and high throughput in the field. TLS was implemented on a novel field phenotyping platform carrying a cable suspended sensor head moveable in 3D over a 1 ha field. Canopy height was recorded on 335 winter wheat genotypes across two consecutive years. Scans were done in 3-d intervals during the stem elongation phase. Per day, 714 plots (two replications plus checks) were scanned within 3.5 h. The results showed that canopy height increased linearly with thermal time. Based on this linearity, 15 and 95\% of final height were used as proxy measures for the onset and termination of stem elongation, respectively. We observed high heritability between 0.76 and 0.91 for the onset, termination and duration of stem elongation. The onset of stem elongation showed a positive covariance with the termination of stem elongation and final height indicating some regulatory dependencies. Yet there was no apparent relationship between onset and duration of stem elongation. Due to its precision, the TLS method allows to measure the dynamics of stem elongation in large sets of genotypes. This in turn offers opportunities to investigate the genetic control of the transitions between early vegetative growth, stem elongation and flowering. Understanding the genetic control of these transitions is an important milestone towards knowledge-based crop improvement.},

Here, we project global demand for crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita demand for crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per capita real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100–110\% increase in global crop demand from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend on how global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural intensification in richer nations and greater land clearing (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, ∼1 billion ha of land would be cleared globally by 2050, with CO

Each iteration forms linear approximations to the objective and constraint functions by interpolation at the vertices of a simplex and a trust region bound restricts each change to the variables. Thus a new vector of variables is calculated, which may replace one of the current vertices, either to improve the shape of the simplex or because it is the best vector that has been found so far, according to a merit function that gives attention to the greatest constraint violation. The trust region radius ρ is never increased, and it is reduced when the approximations of a well-conditioned simplex fail to yield an improvement to the variables, until ρ reaches a prescribed value that controls the final accuracy. Some convergence properties and several numerical results are given, but there are no more than 9 variables in these calculations because linear approximations can be highly inefficient. Nevertheless, the algorithm is easy to use for small numbers of variables.},

	abstract = {Data assimilation, a state-of-the-art method that merges remote sensing data with a dynamic model to improve model performance, has been widely used in land surface process modeling. Application of data assimilation under various water conditions can provide insight of crop response to different water supply rates, which is useful for agricultural water management in arid and semi-arid regions. For this purpose, we developed a generic data assimilation methodology by integrating both the Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) and the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithms into the Simple Algorithm For Yield and Evapotranspiration (SAFYE) model to provide improved simulation of winter wheat biomass and yield, and simulation of evapotranspiration (ET) under different water-supply scenarios. An experiment with nine irrigation scenarios was conducted during the 2013—2015 growing cycles. Field spectral data were employed to retrieve the leaf area index (LAI), which was then used as a single state variable to determine other parameters in the SAFYE model using a global optimization algorithm. Time-series LAI was eventually assimilated in the SAFYE model based on the EnKF algorithm to improve overall model simulation. The results showed that the simulated crop growth dynamics followed the measurements well in most cases when the estimated LAI was assimilated. The accuracy of simulated biomass at the daily step was improved, with the maximum RMSE decreased from 199.4 to 123.8 g m−2 and from 466.6 to 393.4 g m−2 for the 2013–2014 and 2014–2015 growing seasons respectively. A good agreement was also achieved between the estimated and field measured grain yield (R2 = 0.901, RMSE= 31.9 g m−2, RRMSE=6.55\%) for both growing seasons. The simulation of soil water content in the top 0—20 cm soil layer was better (RMSE: 3.3—5.0 mm) than that of 0—100 cm layer (RMSE: 11.7—29.6 mm). Accuracy of the simulated ET under early-stage water deficit scenarios was lower than that under other scenarios, with a positive mean relative error of 14\% (3.4—24.3\%) during two growing seasons. This study demonstrates the great potential of coupling remote sensing data to improve the performance of SAFYE model in modeling winter wheat growth.},

This study evaluates the feasibility of deriving spatially variable crop LUEmax from satellite remote sensing data. LUEmax at the plot level was retrieved first by assimilating field measured green leaf area index and biomass into a crop model (the Simple Algorithm for Yield estimate model), and was then correlated with a few Landsat-8 vegetation indices (VIs) to develop regression models. LUEmax was then mapped using the best regression model from a VI. The influence factors on LUEmax variability were also assessed. Contrary to a fixed LUEmax, our results suggest that LUEmax is affected by environmental stresses, such as leaf nitrogen deficiency. The strong correlation between the plot-level LUEmax and VIs, particularly the two-band enhanced vegetation index for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) and the green chlorophyll index for maize (Zea mays) at the milk stage, provided a potential to derive LUEmax from remote sensing observations. To evaluate the quality of LUEmax derived from remote sensing data, biomass of winter wheat and maize was compared with that estimated using a PEM model with a constant LUEmax and the derived variable LUEmax. Significant improvements in biomass estimation accuracy were achieved (by about 15.0\% for the normalized root-mean-square error) using the derived variable LUEmax . This study offers a new way to derive LUEmax for a specific PEM and to improve the accuracy of biomass estimation using remote sensing.},

            Growth is a widely used term in plant science and ecology, but it can have different meanings depending on the context and the spatiotemporal scale of analysis. At the meristem level, growth is associated with the production of cells and initiation of new organs. At the organ or plant scale and over short time periods, growth is often used synonymously with tissue expansion, while over longer time periods the increase in biomass is a common metric. At even larger temporal and spatial scales, growth is mostly described as net primary production. Here, we first address the question ‘what is growth?’. We propose a general framework to distinguish between the different facets of growth, and the corresponding physiological processes, environmental drivers and mathematical formalisms. Based on these different definitions, we then review how plant growth can be measured and analysed at different organisational, spatial and temporal scales. We conclude by discussing why gaining a better understanding of the different facets of plant growth is essential to disentangle genetic and environmental effects on the phenotype, and to uncover the causalities around source or sink limitations of plant growth.},

	abstract = {The leaf-area index (leaf area per unit area of land, L) of field crops of kale and sugar-beet was varied experimentally by removing different fractions of the plant population distributed uniformly through the crop. The net assimilation rate (E) was determined in subsequent periods of 10-14 days. For kale, E decreased nearly linearly with increase of L throughout the range from 1 to 5. E of sugar-beet was less affected by change in L and was apparently not decreased until L rose above about 3. Because of this dependence of E on L, the rate of dry-matter production per unit area of land, or crop growth-rate (C = EL), showed a curved relation to L; for kale it increased to a maximum when L was between 3 and 4 and fell again at higher values of L. Maximal C for sugar-beet occurred beyond the range of L tested, probably between L = 6 and L = 9. This optimal L for dry-matter production by sugar-beet crops probably lies near the upper limit of the current agricultural range, so there is little, if any, scope for increasing the dry-matter yield by further increase in L. For heavy kale crops L is already far in excess of the optimum, and it may be possible to increase the total dry-matter yield of kale by repeated thinning or defoliation to hold L near the optimum.},

	abstract = {Crop growth monitoring and yield estimate information can be obtained via appropriate metrics such as the leaf area index (LAI) and biomass. Such information is crucial for guiding agricultural production, ensuring food security, and maintaining sustainable agricultural development. Traditional methods of field measurement and monitoring typically have low efficiency and can only give limited untimely information. Alternatively, methods based on remote sensing technologies are fast, objective, and nondestructive. Indeed, remote sensing data assimilation and crop growth modeling represent an important trend in crop growth monitoring and yield estimation. In this study, we assimilate the leaf area index retrieved from Sentinel-2 remote sensing data for crop growth model of the simple algorithm for yield estimation (SAFY) in wheat. The SP-UCI optimization algorithm is used for fine-tuning for several SAFY parameters, namely the emergence date (D0), the effective light energy utilization rate (ELUE), and the senescence temperature threshold (STT) which is indicative of biological aging. These three sensitive parameters are set in order to attain the global minimum of an error function between the SAFY model predicted values and the LAI inversion values. This assimilation of remote sensing data into the crop growth model facilitates the LAI, biomass, and yield estimation. The estimation results were validated using data collected from 48 experimental plots during 2014 and 2015. For the 2014 data, the results showed coefficients of determination (R2) of the LAI, biomass and yield of 0.73, 0.83 and 0.49, respectively, with corresponding root-mean-squared error (RMSE) values of 0.72, 1.13 t/ha and 1.14 t/ha, respectively. For the 2015 data, the estimated R2 values of the LAI, biomass, and yield were 0.700, 0.85, and 0.61, respectively, with respective RMSE values of 0.83, 1.22 t/ha, and 1.39 t/ha, respectively. The estimated values were found to be in good agreement with the measured ones. This shows high applicability of the proposed data assimilation scheme in crop monitoring and yield estimation. As well, this scheme provides a reference for the assimilation of remote sensing data into crop growth models for regional crop monitoring and yield estimation.},

	abstract = {The PROSAIL model is widely used to retrieve vegetation parameters from remote sensing data in agriculture regions. Soil reflectance is a key input to the PROSAIL model, but its influence on vegetation parameters retrieval accuracy of crops is rarely discussed. Therefore, this study investigated the influence of different soil reflectance schemes on leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) retrieval accuracy based on the PROSAIL model in an agriculture region. Firstly, three sources of soil reflectance including ICRAF-ISRIC soil spectral library (SR\_SSL), general spectral vectors model (SR\_GSV), and ASD spectroradiometer measurement (SR\_ASD) and two reflectance extraction schemes were used to generate input soil reflectance for the PROSAIL model to simulate canopy reflectance. Then, the LAI and FVC retrieval models were developed using the random forest algorithm and validated using field survey data. Determination coefficient (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and normalized RMSE (NRMSE) were used to evaluate the accuracy of LAI and FVC retrieval. Under the direct extraction scheme, the LAI retrieval based on SR\_ASD (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.613, NRMSE = 0.269) achieved better performance than SR\_GSV (R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 0.671, NRMSE = 0.294) and SR\_SSL (R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 0.762, NRMSE = 0.334), whereas the performances of FVC retrieval were comparable for SR\_ASD (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.084, NRMSE = 0.136), SR\_GSV (R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.086, NRMSE = 0.139) and SR\_SSL (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.091, NRMSE = 0.147). The influence of soil reflectance on LAI retrieval is larger than that of FVC in this study. Furthermore, soil reflectance was more important for canopies characterized by low LAI and FVC. In addition, the combination of SR\_SSL and multiplication coefficients scheme could be conveniently used for large areas vegetation parameters retrieval. While SR\_GSV and SR\_ASD with direct extraction scheme was suitable for small areas with field survey data and more homogeneous region.},

	abstract = {Predicting plant development is a long-desired goal of crop physiology. Plant growth divides into two main, interwoven components: continuous growth, and the succession of growth stages (phenology). Growth is commonly modeled on species-level as per se response to temperature that is scaled to cultivar-specific intrinsic growth rates. Differences in phenology—exhibited by cultivars in different environments—are interpreted as interactions with remaining environmental covariates. We question this fundamental assumption and suspect that cultivar-specific temperature responses largely influence phenology.To gather evidence, temporally resolved plant organ tracking and field phenotyping data were collected over multiple years in winter wheat and soybean. The response of traits to temperature was examined using models of increasing complexity (ranging from linear models to hierarchical splines and neural networks). Additionally, the trait level (leaf growth, canopy development, stem elongation), the covariate level (soil temperature, air temperature) and the covariate measurement level (below/inside canopies, at a reference weather station) were varied.The cultivar-specific non-linear models explained, in contrast to thermal time, large proportions of phenology-related cultivar-by-environment interactions.We conclude that such unbiased predictions are essential in breeding and for the cultivation of crops in view of increasing heat, drought, and other adverse climatic conditions.},

Winter crops show senescence caused by cold spells, visible as declines in leaf area. We accurately quantified such declines by monitoring changes in canopy cover based on time-resolved high-resolution imagery in the field. Thirty-six winter wheat genotypes were measured in multiple years. A concept termed “frost damage index” (FDI) was developed that, in analogy to growing degree days, summarizes frost events in a cumulative way. The measured sensitivity of genotypes to the FDI correlated with visual scorings commonly used in breeding to assess winter hardiness. The FDI concept could be adapted to other factors such as drought or heat stress. While commonly not considered in plant growth modeling, integrating such degradation processes may be key to improving the prediction of plant performance for future climate scenarios.},

Automated image processing of time-lapse records of these organs has led to understanding of spatial and temporal patterns of growth on time scales from minutes to weeks. Growth zones in roots and leaves show distinct patterns during a diel cycle (24 h period). In dicot leaves under nonstressful conditions these patterns are characterized by endogenous rhythms, sometimes superimposed upon morphogenesis driven by environmental variation. In roots and monocot leaves the growth patterns depend more strongly on environmental fluctuations. Because the impact of spatial variations and temporal fluctuations of above- and belowground environmental parameters must be processed by the plant body as an entire system whose individual modules interact on different levels, growth reactions of individual modules are often highly nonlinear. A mechanistic understanding of plant resource use efficiency and performance in a dynamically fluctuating environment therefore requires an accurate analysis of leaf and root growth patterns in conjunction with knowledge of major intraplant communication systems and metabolic pathways.},

Stakeholders from more than 32 countries download the JRC MARS Bulletin, in peak-season up to 1500 downloads occur in the first days after publication. The readership of the Bulletin is diverse, coming from governments (e.g. Ministries of Agriculture), private companies (e.g. commodity traders, banking), media, and research and academia. On the list of stakeholders that want to be notified of the release of the Bulletin, roughly 37\% originate from business, 35\% from research and development, 22\% from government, and 6\% from the media. The primary user is the Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development (DG-AGRI) of the European Commission, which uses the forecasts to quantify the production estimates for crop supply balance sheets and to identify regions with exceptional (mostly weather related) challenges that might require a policy response. The information for wheat, maize and rice is shared through the Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) thus contributing to increased global market transparency and better governance of agriculture and food policies. The largest business use is in market information, financial, and consultancy services, followed by commodity trading. Examples of use in media reports as well as online feedback to those, e.g. by farmer's organizations, are also presented. Downloads of the Bulletin peak in the month before harvest at the time when the forecasts can be of most value for stakeholder decision-making.},

            For some applications, long‐term coverage and climate consistency are important requirements in gridded climate data sets. This is often challenged by the inhomogeneity of measurements and by the variation of station networks over time. We describe the development of new monthly grid data sets of temperature and precipitation for Switzerland that range back as far as 1864 and satisfy high standards in long‐term consistency. To this end, data are incorporated from stations only with complete and homogenized series available. To compensate for the limited spatial coverage, our analysis integrates statistical information from high‐resolution grid data sets based on a dense network but over a limited period. For Switzerland, we demonstrate that the statistical reconstruction recovers mesoscale features not resolved by the stations alone. The method is fairly robust against representativity biases during calibration. The resulting trend maps are more plausible than those from common interpolation with more extensive but variable station networks. Typical errors in the analyses are 0.2 °C for monthly temperature and 10\% for precipitation, but they can be larger in regions with low station density. In 75\% of all months, the reconstructions explain more than 90\% of the spatial variance for temperature and more than 60\% for precipitation. From the new data sets, we infer a warming trend of around 1.3 °C per century in the period 1864–2017, increasing to more than 0.35 °C per decade for 1961–2017. Precipitation trends are not statistically significant, except in winter, when an increase of 1–3\% per decade is found in the north and west of the country.

            The spring phenology of plants in temperate regions strongly responds to spring temperatures. Climate warming has caused substantial phenological advances in the past, but trends to be expected in the future are uncertain. A simple indicator is temperature sensitivity, the phenological advance statistically associated with a 1°C warmer mean temperature during the “preseason”, defined as the most temperature‐sensitive period preceding the phenological event. Recent analyses of phenological records have shown a decline in temperature sensitivity of leaf unfolding, but underlying mechanisms were not clear. Here, we propose that climate warming can reduce temperature sensitivity simply by reducing the length of the preseason due to faster bud development during this time period, unless the entire preseason shifts forward so that its temperature does not change. We derive these predictions theoretically from the widely used “thermal time model” for bud development and test them using data for 19 phenological events recorded in 1970–2012 at 108 stations spanning a 1600 m altitudinal range in Switzerland. We consider how temperature sensitivity, preseason start, preseason length and preseason temperature change (i) with altitude, (ii) between the periods 1970–1987 and 1995–2012, which differed mainly in spring temperatures, and (iii) between two non‐consecutive sets of 18 years that differed mainly in winter temperatures. On average, temperature sensitivity increased with altitude (colder climate) and was reduced in years with warmer springs, but not in years with warmer winters. These trends also varied among species. Decreasing temperature sensitivity in warmer springs was associated with a limited forward shift of preseason start, higher temperatures during the preseason and reduced preseason length, but not with reduced winter chilling. Our results imply that declining temperature sensitivity can result directly from spring warming and does not necessarily indicate altered physiological responses or stronger constraints such as reduced winter chilling.},

	abstract = {Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is the most widely grown food crop in the world threatened by future climate change. In this study, we simulated climate change impacts and adaptation strategies for wheat globally using new crop genetic traits (CGT), including increased heat tolerance, early vigor to increase early crop water use, late flowering to reverse an earlier anthesis in warmer conditions, and the combined traits with additional nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications, as an option to maximize genetic gains. These simulations were completed using three wheat crop models and five Global Climate Models (GCM) for RCP 8.5 at mid-century. Crop simulations were compared with country, US state, and US county grain yield and production. Wheat yield and production from high-yielding and low-yielding countries were mostly captured by the model ensemble mean. However, US state and county yields and production were often poorly reproduced, with large variability in the models, which is likely due to poor soil and crop management input data at this scale. Climate change is projected to decrease global wheat production by −1.9\% by mid-century. However, the most negative impacts are projected to affect developing countries in tropical regions. The model ensemble mean suggests large negative yield impacts for African and Southern Asian countries where food security is already a problem. Yields are predicted to decline by −15\% in African countries and −16\% in Southern Asian countries by 2050. Introducing CGT as an adaptation to climate change improved wheat yield in many regions, but due to poor nutrient management, many developing countries only benefited from adaptation from CGT when combined with additional N fertilizer. As growing conditions and the impact from climate change on wheat vary across the globe, region-specific adaptation strategies need to be explored to increase the possible benefits of adaptations to climate change in the future.},

The extent of heat stress for agricultural crops depends on the co-occurrence of heat periods and heat sensitive phenological stages. Using the Wang and Engel phenology model and the most recent climate change projections for four sites across the Swiss Central Plateau, we estimated future heat stress exposure in Swiss wheat production and tested the potential of winter wheat genotypes with differing phenological characteristics to escape future heat periods. Across all genotypes, heat stress days (Tmax ≥ 30 °C) during the temperature sensitive stages of flowering and early grain filling increased from an average of 1.5 heat days in 1982−2006 to 2.1 by 2075−2099 with RCP2.6 (with climate change mitigation) and to 3.6 by 2075−2099 with RCP8.5 (without climate change mitigation), respectively. Across all genotypes and locations, a considerable escape from future heat periods was modelled due to a mainly temperature-driven advancement in the phenological development. Under both RCP scenarios, we predicted lower exposure to heat stress for early varieties than for late varieties. However, under the RCP8.5 scenario, for each location, heat stress exposure for early varieties was still projected to be higher by 2075−2099 than for late varieties under current conditions. Further, heat stress exposure was considerably increased at locations with cooler spring conditions, slowing down the early season phenological development and resulting in late heading dates. Our findings imply needs for a regionally adequate cultivar selection as well as for phenological adaptions and heat tolerance traits in Swiss wheat breeding to adapt to future climate change and regional climatic differences. Different strategies of breeding adaptations and their trade-offs are discussed.},

            The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Models that predict crop development can serve as decision-support tools in crop management. This paper describes a phenology simulation model for the winter wheat shoot apex and reports validation and sensitivity analysis results.The complete developmental sequence of the winter wheat shoot apex is quantitatively outlined and correlated with commonly recognised phenological growth stages. The phyllochron is used to measure the thermal time between most phenological growth stages, thereby increasing the flexibility over the growing degree-day (GDD) and photothermal approaches. Nineteen site-years covering a range of climatic conditions, cultural practices and cultivars across the Central Great Plains, USA, are used to validate the model.Validation results show that the predicted phyllochron (108 GDD) agrees well with the observed phyllochron (107 GDD) for ten cultivars. Mean seedling emergence is predicted to within 2 days in almost all of the 19 site-years. The ability of the model to predict growth stages accurately increased successively from jointing to heading to maturity. Maturity is generally predicted to within 5 days of the observed day.After validation, recalibration of the phyllochron estimates between growth stages are provided, and corrections for mesic and xeric conditions are suggested. Further validation of the entire developmental sequence of the shoot apex is recommended.},

	abstract = {Rigorous calibration of crop phenology models, providing both best-estimate parameters and estimates of parameter uncertainty, is essential for evaluating how crops will respond to future environmental and management changes. Least squares parameter estimation is a widely used approach to calibration of nonlinear models, and there are many software packages available for implementing this approach. However, these packages are rarely if ever used for complex phenology models because of technical difficulties. The purpose of this research is to overcome these difficulties, in particular the issue of a model which is a discontinuous function of the parameters. The calculations were conducted with the WheatGrow phenology model, but the approach is applicable to other complex phenology models. The approach was used to calibrate WheatGrow phenology for 4 widely used cultivars in the main winter wheat production region of China. The resulting fit to the data was quite good (root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3–4 days for flowering and maturity). The coefficients of variation (CV) of the parameters ranged from 6\% to 40\%. Furthermore, the model was used to predict the effect of warming on phenology, and the uncertainty in those predictions. The results showed that each degree of warming reduced the time from sowing to flowering by 7–8 days for the spring cultivars and 3–4 days for the winter cultivars. The time form flowering to maturity is hardly affected. In addition, the higher the temperature, the larger the uncertainty in the predictions. Comparison with variability in multi-model ensembles suggests that parameter uncertainty is less than the model uncertainty.},

Here, we explore the interactions between number of measurements, noise and model predictive skills to simulate the impact of 2050′s climate change (RCP8.5) on winter wheat flowering time. The learning curve of two winter wheat phenology models is analysed under different assumptions about the size of the calibration dataset, the measurement error and the accuracy of the model structure. Our assessment confirms that prediction skills improve asymptotically with the size of the calibration dataset, as with statistical models. Results suggest that less precise but larger training datasets can improve the predictive abilities of models. However, the non-linear relationship between number of measurements, measurement error, and prediction skills limit the compensation between data quality and quantity. We find that the model performance does not improve significantly with a theoretical minimum size of 7–9 observations when the model structure is approximate. While simulation of crop phenology is critical to crop model simulation, more studies are needed to explore data needs for assessing entire crop models.},

Dataset of phenological observations complemented with regional cropping calendars across Europe is used. The calibration of thermal requirements for anthesis and maturity is done by pooling all available observations within European agro-environmental zones and minimizing an objective function that combines the differences between observed and simulated anthesis, maturity and harvest dates. Calibrated phenology results in substantial improvement in simulated dates of anthesis with respect to the original MCYFS simulations. The combined improvements to the system result in a physically more plausible spatial distribution of crop model indicators across Europe. Crop yield indicators point to better agreement with recorded national winter wheat yields with respect to the original MCYFS simulations, most pronounced in central, eastern and southern Europe. However, model skill remains low in large parts of western Europe, which may possibly be attributed to the impacts of wet conditions.},

	abstract = {Sowing dates have a great influence on crop yields as they affect what environmental conditions the plants will experience. Therefore, sowing dates are important to many individuals and organizations on the food production chain, including food manufacturers and traders. Despite their importance, large-scale comprehensive data on sowing dates are currently rare and often available only as broad estimates at the state, county or district level. Continuously obtaining sowing dates at the field scale is expensive, time-consuming and prone to human errors. Remote sensing on the other hand has the potential of conducting rapid, cost-effective and continuous surveys of farm management practices over large scales. Over the last decade, a new era in Earth observation satellites began with the production and deployment of smaller, lighter and cheaper nano-satellites known as CubeSats. Images from these satellites can potentially be used to capture sowing dates over time. In this study, we developed an innovative semi-automated sowing date detection methodology, which uses high spatio-temporal resolution CubeSat images to detect sowing dates at the field scale. We identified the sowing dates by using Planet’s PlanetScope data to detect changes on the fields’ surface caused by no-tillage sowing. Our approach overcame the signal inconsistences existing among the numerous sensors in the constellation, and detected 85\% of the sown fields with R2 = 0.99. We succeeded to identify the actual sowing dates of individual fields with a median gap of 0 days within an unparalleled RMSE of 0.9 and 1.9 days in a set of national trials and in fields of a commercial farm, respectively. The methodology presented in this study can be used to produce and update field level crop statistics on a near daily-basis at a low cost. It is robust and simple and can be applied over a wide range of soil types, atmospheric conditions, crop types and sensors, to detect sowing dates in regions where no-tillage sowing is practiced.},

	abstract = {Crop simulation models are commonly used to forecast the performance of cropping systems under different hypotheses of change. Their use on a regional scale is generally constrained, however, by a lack of information on the spatial and temporal variability of environment-related input variables (e.g., soil) and agricultural practices (e.g., sowing dates) that influence crop yields. Satellite remote sensing data can shed light on such variability by providing timely information on crop dynamics and conditions over large areas. This paper proposes a method for analyzing time series of MODIS satellite data in order to estimate the inter-annual variability of winter wheat sowing dates. A rule-based method was developed to automatically identify a reliable sample of winter wheat field time series, and to infer the corresponding sowing dates. The method was designed for a case study in the Camargue region (France), where winter wheat is characterized by vernalization, as in other temperate regions. The detection criteria were chosen on the grounds of agronomic expertise and by analyzing high-confidence time-series vegetation index profiles for winter wheat. This automatic method identified the target crop on more than 56\% (four-year average) of the cultivated areas, with low commission errors (11\%). It also captured the seasonal variability in sowing dates with errors of ±8 and ±16days in 46\% and 66\% of cases, respectively. Extending the analysis to the years 2002–2012 showed that sowing in the Camargue was usually done on or around November 1st (±4days). Comparing inter-annual sowing date variability with the main local agro-climatic drivers showed that the type of preceding crop and the weather conditions during the summer season before the wheat sowing had a prominent role in influencing winter wheat sowing dates.},

Consequently, the selection of metrics, i.e., temporal descriptors that predict grain yield, has likely been driven by practicality and data availability rather than by systematic targetting of critically sensitive periods as suggested by knowledge of crop physiology. The current trend towards hyper-temporal data raises two questions: How does temporality affect the accuracy of empirical models? Which metrics achieve optimal performance? We followed an in silico approach based on crop modelling which can generate any observation frequency, explore a range of growing conditions and reduce the cost of measuring yields in situ. We simulated wheat crops across Australia and regressed six types of metrics derived from the resulting time series of Leaf Area Index (LAI) against wheat yields. Empirical models using advanced LAI metrics achieved national relevance and, contrary to simple metrics, did not benefit from the addition of weather information. This suggests that they already integrate most climatic effects on yield. Simple metrics remained the best choice when LAI data are sparse. As we progress into a data-rich era, our results support a shift towards metrics that truly harness the temporal dimension of LAI data.},

	abstract = {Climate plays a fundamental role in agriculture. The quantity and quality of crop yield can be affected by water stress, heat stress or frost or by pests and diseases. As climate conditions change, suitability zones for the cultivation of specific crops may shift. For planners and land managers it is important to understand such changes in order to develop short- and long-term adaptation strategies for resource and development planning. In this paper, we present a flexible and comprehensive, rule-based approach for evaluating crop-specific climate suitability. Climate indices are calculated over dynamically estimated phenological phases, and factor suitability functions are defined to relate these phase-specific climate indices to suitability values. The dynamic consideration of crop phenology allows to assess effects of climate-induced shifts in phenological development. To complement the knowledge-based definition of factor suitability functions with empirical data, we introduce an automated procedure for refining this definition within knowledge-based bounds based on observed climate and yield data. The approach was tested and applied for grain maize (Zea mays L.) production in Switzerland. Comparison with independent yield data showed a good agreement with crop-specific climatic suitability, both in terms of temporal and spatial variability. Analysis of phase-specific suitability limitations at three representative sites revealed that suitability during the period 1981–2011 was mostly limited by sub-optimum temperatures and radiation during early and late phases, whereas drought was only an important limitation in exceptionally dry years (e.g. 2003 and 2010). An analysis of constant changes in temperature and precipitation indicated that grain maize suitability at a selected site on the western Central Plateau was more sensitive to temperature changes than to changes in precipitation. This suggests that this crop could benefit from an increase in temperature, not only through shifting towards the temperature optimum, but also by avoiding drought stress through accelerated plant development. However, these positive effects could be counteracted by negative effects of shortened phenology (i.e. reduced biomass accumulation) and heat stress. These results show that the approach offers diverse possibilities for applications, including climate impacts studies, and serves to provide information for the planning of crop adaptation strategies.},

	abstract = {Satellite-based models are important tools for monitoring regional and global crop yields, because remotely sensed data is able to offer temporally and spatially continuous crop growth information over large areas. However, tracking inter-annual variability in crop yields remains a major challenge. Taking this challenge, a light use efficiency model (EC-LUE) is used to estimate winter wheat yield with 30-m spatial resolution Landsat data. Moreover, we integrate winter wheat variety data by considering different percentages of harvested organs to total crop organs. Using county-level statistical yield data for Kansas, United States, model validation shows that the EC-LUE model combined with wheat variety data can effectively capture the spatial variations of winter wheat yields. Specifically, the proposed method significantly improves model simulation performance for the inter-annual variation of yields during 2008–2017 and can explain 82\% of the inter-annual yield variation. This method proposed in this study proves to be available for future applications of crop yield estimations on a larger scale. The great potential of incorporating satellite observations with crop variety data to monitor crop yield, and improve agricultural management is therefore indicated.},

	abstract = {In this study, the performance of nine widely used and accessible crop growth simulation models (APES-ACE, CROPSYST, DAISY, DSSAT-CERES, FASSET, HERMES, MONICA, STICS and WOFOST) was compared during 44 growing seasons of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) at seven sites in Northern and Central Europe. The aims of this model comparison were to examine how different process-based crop models perform at multiple sites across Europe when applied with minimal information for model calibration of spring barley at field scale, whether individual models perform better than the multi-model mean, and what the uncertainty ranges are in simulated grain yields. The reasons for differences among the models and how results for barley compare to winter wheat are discussed. Regarding yield estimation, best performing based on the root mean square error (RMSE) were models HERMES, MONICA and WOFOST with lowest values of 1124, 1282 and 1325 (kgha−1), respectively. Applying the index of agreement (IA), models WOFOST, DAISY and HERMES scored best having highest values (0.632, 0.631 and 0.585, respectively). Most models systematically underestimated yields, whereby CROPSYST showed the highest deviation as indicated by the mean bias error (MBE) (−1159kgha−1). While the wide range of simulated yields across all sites and years shows the high uncertainties in model estimates with only restricted calibration, mean predictions from the nine models agreed well with observations. Results of this paper also show that models that were more accurate in predicting phenology were not necessarily the ones better estimating grain yields. Total above-ground biomass estimates often did not follow the patterns of grain yield estimates and, thus, harvest indices were also different. Estimates of soil moisture dynamics varied greatly. In comparison, even though the growing cycle for winter wheat is several months longer than for spring barley, using RMSE and IA as indicators, models performed slightly, but not significantly, better in predicting wheat yields. Errors in reproducing crop phenology were similar, which in conjunction with the shorter growth cycle of barley has higher effects on accuracy in yield prediction.},

	abstract = {Time series of optical imagery allow to derive land surface phenology metrics. These metrics are only complete with a statement about their uncertainty. A source of uncertainty is the radiometry of the sensor. We propagated radiometric uncertainties within a Monte-Carlo framework into phenological metrics using the TIMESAT approach based on time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), three-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Green Leaf Area Index (GLAI) derived from radiative transfer modelling. Additionally, we studied the effect of propagated uncertainties on scene pre-classification. We focused on Sentinel-2 MSI TOA data since quantitative estimates of radiometric uncertainties are available. Propagation was carried out for a growing season over an agricultural region in Switzerland. Propagated uncertainties had little impact on the classification except for spectrally mixed pixels. Effects on the spectral indices and GLAI were more pronounced. In detail, GLAI was more uncertain due to the ill-posedness of radiative transfer model inversion (median relative uncertainty for all crop pixels and Sentinel-2 scenes: 4.4\%) than EVI (2.7\%) and NDVI (1.1\%). Regarding phenology, metrics exhibited largest uncertainties in the case of GLAI. The magnitude of uncertainty in the metrics depends on the inter-scene error correlation, which we assumed to be either zero (uncorrelated) or one (fully correlated) since the actual correlation is unknown. If uncertainties are fully correlated, uncertainties in metrics are small (2 to 3 days) but take values up to greater 10 days under the uncorrelated assumption. Thus, our work provides guidance for the interpretation of phenological metrics.},

	abstract = {Background Timely sowing is an important agronomic measure to ensure the normal germination, stable seedling establishment, and yield formation for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Delayed sowing frequently occurs in the current multi-cropping system and mechanized production of this crop. However, the ways in which different sowing dates affect yield and its potential mechanism is still unknown in the middle-lower Yangtze River Basin. We sought to provide a theoretical basis for these mechanisms to improve regional wheat production. Methods We investigated the wheat’s yield differences in a two-year field study under different sowing dates and took into account related growth characteristics including meteorological conditions, growth period, tillers, dry matter accumulation (DMA), and nitrogen accumulation (NA). We used the logistic curve model to simulate DMA and NA dynamics of single stem wheat under different sowing dates. We then analyzed and compared wheat accumulation for different sowing dates. Results Our results showed that grain yield declined by 0.97 ± 0.22\% with each one-day change (either early or delayed) in sowing beyond the normal sowing date. The yield loss could be explained by the inhibition of crop growth, yield components, biomass and nitrogen (N) production. The negative effects of delayed sowing were caused by environmental limitations including adverse weather factors such as low temperature during vegetative growth, shortened duration of various phases of crop development, and increased temperature during the grain-filling period. The grain yield gap decreased between the late and normal sowing periods owing to a compensatory effect between the highest average rates (Vt) and the rapid accumulation period (T) of DMA and NA for single stem wheat. The grain yield was maintained at 6,000 kg ha−1 or more when the ratio of DMA at the mature-to-jointing stage (MD/JD) and the ratio of NA at the mature-to-jointing stage (MN/JN) was 4.06 (P {\textless} 0.01) and 2.49 (P {\textless} 0.05), respectively. The compensatory effect did not prevent the impact caused by delayed sowing, which caused biomass and N production to decrease. Physiological development reached a maximal accumulation rate (Tm) of NA earlier than DMA.},

	abstract = {Timely sowing and harvesting play important roles in agricultural production. The appropriate management decisions are necessary to cope with climate change and ensure high and stable crop yields. This study analyzed the effects of sowing date on the growth process of winter wheat and quantified the effects of climate resources and photothermal potential yield on theoretical yield at different stages of winter wheat. The analysis was based on the data from winter wheat interval sowing experiments conducted at the Hebei Gucheng Agricultural Meteorology National Observation and Research Station (Gucheng station) in north China (115°40′ E, 39°08′ N) during 2017–2019. The results showed that: (1) with the delay in sowing date, the growth process of winter wheat significantly advanced, the proportion of vegetative growth period significantly reduced (0.19\% for per day delay), the proportion of reproductive growth period (RGP) significantly increased (0.12\% for per day delay), and the prewintering light and temperature resources significantly reduced (12.2 °C·d accumulated temperature and 19.0 MJ·m−2 solar radiation for per day delay); (2) the theoretical yield of winter wheat showed a significant exponential relationship with the photothermal potential yield of the whole growth period: the minimum photothermal potential for yield formation was 26.6 t·ha−1, and the maximum theoretical yield was 12.6 t·ha−1; and (3) the wheat yield and yield stability were highest when the RGP photothermal potential yield was 16.0 t·ha−1 and the prewintering active accumulated temperature was 400 °C·d. This study also proposed a method to estimate the suitable sowing and harvesting dates to achieve high and stable yield of winter wheat, showing that the suitable sowing dates of winter wheat at Gucheng station from 1997 to 2021 ranged from 1 to 15 October, with no significant interannual variation; the suitable harvesting period ranged from 5 June to 10 July and showed a trend of gradual advance with the delay of the year. The results of the study provide a reference for sowing date adjustment of crops to adapt to climate change.},

However, the ability of MME to capture crop responses to changes in sowing dates and densities has not yet been investigated. These management interventions are some of the main levers for adapting cropping systems to climate change. Here, we explore the performance of a MME of 29 wheat crop models to predict the effect of changing sowing dates and rates on yield and yield components, on two sites located in a high-yielding environment in New Zealand. The experiment was conducted for 6 years and provided 50 combinations of sowing date, sowing density and growing season. We show that the MME simulates seasonal growth of wheat well under standard sowing conditions, but fails under early sowing and high sowing rates. The comparison between observed and simulated in-season fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (FIPAR) for early sown wheat shows that the MME does not capture the decrease of crop above ground biomass during winter months due to senescence. Models need to better account for tiller competition for light, nutrients, and water during vegetative growth, and early tiller senescence and tiller mortality, which are exacerbated by early sowing, high sowing densities, and warmer winter temperatures.},

	abstract = {Continuous time series crop growth monitoring during the main crop growth and development period at field scales is very important for crop management and yield estimation. For more than a decade, the time series leaf area index (LAI) products obtained from high temporal resolution satellites have been widely used in global crop growth monitoring. However, the spatial resolutions (250–1000 m) of these satellite sensors are too coarse for areas with complex and diverse land-use types, especially in China, which causes great uncertainties in crop growth monitoring and yield estimation results. In addition, due to the influence of clouds, optical remote sensing satellites cannot obtain continuous time series data at a given time step over the main crop growth and development period. In this paper, a method based on spatiotemporal data fusion and singular vector decomposition (SVD) is proposed to reconstruct field-scale time series LAI imagery over the main growth and development period of winter wheat. In this method, the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) is used to fuse the reflectance imagery of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3, and a linear regression model between the LAI data retrieved from the fused reflectance data and the singular vectors derived from the 4-day interval Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI data is established to reconstruct the continuous time series field-scale LAI imagery at a given time step. The accuracy of the reconstructed LAI and its capability for winter wheat yield estimation were tested on the Guanzhong Plain of China. The results indicate that (1) the ESTARFM model can fuse the reflectance bands from visible to shortwave infrared of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 on the Guanzhong Plain accurately within a 20-day interval of the winter wheat growth and development period; (2) the 4-day interval field-scale LAI imagery over the main winter wheat growth and development period can be accurately reconstructed based on the linear regression models between the fused LAI data and the singular vectors derived from the 4-day interval MODIS LAI data; and (3) the yield map estimated from the reconstructed field-scale LAI shows more yield distribution details than MODIS yield estimation results. This study shows the feasibility of reconstructing continuous time series field-scale LAI data over the main winter wheat growth and development period on the Guanzhong Plain by combining the spatiotemporal data fusion model with SVD and the potential for estimating the winter wheat yield at field scales.},

	abstract = {The current trend in land-surface and carbon modelling development is largely dichotomous: simple algorithms which minimise the number of biophysical parameters and meteorological drivers versus complex ecophysiologically based models which do not. Understanding the sensitivity of both types of approach to current uncertainties in Leaf Area Index (LAI) and meteorological forcing is an important step in producing accurate model predictions of land–atmosphere carbon exchange. We force two quite disparate models (the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Light-Use Efficiency (LUE) algorithm and the ecophysiological model JULES-SF) with two LAI forcings (satellite and site-normalised) and two meteorologies (tower-based and reanalysis). Simulations are conducted for 67 sites and 10 vegetation classes. The sensitivity of modelled Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) to both LAI and meteorological forcing, thus derived, is compared with model bias against observed carbon fluxes. Our most novel findings are as follows: uncertainty in model formulation (LUE versus ecophysiological) is at least as important (20\% change in simulated GPP) as that pertaining to LAI and meteorological forcing (10–20\% change). However, all these uncertainties are modest compared to both model bias (≤30\%) and inconsistencies between observational datasets used for model calibration (45\%). The ecophysiological model is more sensitive to meteorology (20\% change in simulated GPP) than the LUE algorithm (10\%) owing to the former's reliance on precipitation and shortwave radiation to calculate, respectively, the internal balances of water and energy.},

	abstract = {The accurate simulation of leaf area in wheat models is important because leaf area intercepts light and stores nitrogen, and the arrangement of leaves influences the transmission of foliar diseases and inter-species competition. In this paper, we report on the development and testing of a model that links a mechanistic phenological model that depends on the prediction of leaf appearance (Sirius) with a simplification of a detailed canopy model that calculates the numbers and areas of leaves on mainstems and tillers (ARCWHEAT1). The simplification of the detailed canopy model from ARCWHEAT1 assigns a particular area with the each cohort of leaves associated with a mainstem leaf, but does not predict the number of elements. This is used to replace the empirical curve representing green area index (GAI) development in Sirius. Area development in each layer is described by potential functions, representing how growth proceeds in the absence of resource limitations. Actual area achieved is derived from these potentials using simple limitation rules. Potential for future growth is updated according to the history of resource availability. We propose that modelling potential areas in this fashion is a straightforward way to describe the genetic control of the plant phenotype. The new model requires the calibration of fewer cultivar specific parameters than either of the parent models, making cultivar calibration simpler. It also provides steps towards the simulation of the development of foliar disease and its impact, improved simulation of inter-species competition and the risk of lodging, under a wide range of management and environmental scenarios. This creates a framework for the design of the optimal canopy ideotype to suit these scenarios.},

	abstract = {The present study aimed at testing the potential of the future E.O. mission Sentinel-2 (European GMES programme) for the operational estimation of the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of three contrasting agricultural crops (wheat, sugar beet, and maize). Retrieval of LAI was achieved by using a look-up table (LUT) based inversion of a radiative transfer model (SAILH+PROSPECT). Analyses were mainly carried out using hyperspectral data acquired by the optical airborne instrument CASI, simulating the future Sentinel-2 band setting. Estimated LAI was evaluated using measurements of effective Plant Area Index (PAIeff) collected during the ESA AgriSAR 2006 campaign. Additionally, measurements from two other experiments were tested to enrich the validation database. The GMES targeted precision of 10\% for green LAI estimation was met for sugar beet (8\%), at the limit for wheat (11\%) but not for maize (19\%). For the three crops the RMSE was in the range 0.4-0.6. The results demonstrate the importance of using crop specific radiative transfer models. For row crops with incomplete coverage and strong leaf clumping, such as maize at early stage, the standard SAILH+PROSPECT model does not appear suitable. However, results must be taken cautiously in view of possible uncertainties of the PAIeff measurements. Within a future Sentinel-2 product validation framework, a standard protocol for reference measurements is required to assure consistency of validation data sets.},

We then review literature describing the responses of wheat plants to extreme temperatures. Cardinal temperature thresholds for different phenological processes in wheat are identified and we outline the effects of temperature on rates of growth and development. Finally, we assess the implications of the above for future climatic impact studies. Our summary shows how relatively small and consistent are the standard errors of the cardinal mean temperatures for many of the processes examined. Cardinal temperatures are conservative between studies and are seemingly well-defined in wheat. Into this category we put the lethal limits for wheat, the sterility response at anthesis, the cardinal temperatures for vernalization and some of the base and optimal temperatures. Important questions for the future involve the effects of combinations of extreme events and the modelling of specific effects such as the influence of high temperatures on grain set.},

In this study, the development of the fIPAR/GLAI relationship of three maize hybrids having contrasting plant type and grown in different environmental conditions was characterized. Three field experiments were conducted at Rojas (34°08′S), Argentina, on a silty clay loam soil, without nutrient restriction. The effects of sowing date and water regime were tested. Plant density was always 7 plants m−2. The fIPAR was calculated from measurements above and below the canopy, before and after maximum GLAI was attained. Hybrids differed significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) in individual leaf area, leaf angle, and GLAI evolution. Exponential models adequately described (r2 {\textgreater} 0.77; n ≥ 15) the fIPAR/GLAI relationship for pre-maximum GLAI data of all hybrids. Nevertheless, maximum fIPAR was always below values quoted in the literature ({\textless} 0.90), and differences were detected among hybrids in the attenuation coefficient (k) that were probably related to leaf angle and leaf area. For hybrids with a similar leaf angle at all leaf positions no difference existed in the fIPAR/GLAI relationship along the cycle (pre- and post-maximum GLAI). The relationship changed after tasselling for the hybrid with erect upper leaves. Ignoring such differences could be misleading when fIPAR/GLAI models are used to estimate canopy photosynthesis and hence biomass production, radiation-use efficiency, and kernel set of specific hybrids and growth stages.},

A wide range of optical sensing platforms, from ground-based to airborne and satellite, provide spatially continuous information on terrestrial vegetation status and functioning. As optical Earth observation (EO) data are usually routinely acquired, vegetation can be monitored repeatedly over time; reflecting seasonal vegetation patterns and trends in vegetation productivity metrics. Such metrics include e.g., gross primary productivity, net primary productivity, biomass or yield. To summarize current knowledge, in this paper, we systematically reviewed time series (TS) literature for assessing state-of-the-art vegetation productivity monitoring approaches for different ecosystems based on optical remote sensing (RS) data. As the integration of solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) data in vegetation productivity processing chains has emerged as a promising source, we also include this relatively recent sensor modality. We define three methodological categories to derive productivity metrics from remotely sensed TS of vegetation indices or quantitative traits: (i) trend analysis and anomaly detection, (ii) land surface phenology, and (iii) integration and assimilation of TS-derived metrics into statistical and process-based dynamic vegetation models (DVM). Although the majority of used TS data streams originate from data acquired from satellite platforms, TS data from aircraft and unoccupied aerial vehicles have found their way into productivity monitoring studies. To facilitate processing, we provide a list of common toolboxes for inferring productivity metrics and information from TS data. We further discuss validation strategies of the RS-data derived productivity metrics: (1) using {\textless}em{\textgreater}in situ{\textless}/em{\textgreater} measured data, such as yield, (2) sensor networks of distinct sensors, including spectroradiometers, flux towers, or phenological cameras, and (3) inter-comparison of different productivity products or modelled estimates. Finally, we address current challenges and propose a conceptual framework for productivity metrics derivation, including fully-integrated DVMs and radiative transfer models here labelled as "Digital Twin". This novel framework meets the requirements of multiple ecosystems and enables both an improved understanding of vegetation temporal dynamics in response to climate and environmental drivers and also enhances the accuracy of vegetation productivity monitoring.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The development and validation of hydroecological land-surface models to simulate agricultural areas require extensive data on weather, soil properties, agricultural management, and vegetation states and fluxes. However, these comprehensive data are rarely available since measurement, quality control, documentation, and compilation of the different data types are costly in terms of time and money. Here, we present a comprehensive dataset, which was collected at four agricultural sites within the Rur catchment in western Germany in the framework of the Transregional Collaborative Research Centre 32 (TR32) “Patterns in Soil–Vegetation–Atmosphere Systems: Monitoring, Modeling and Data Assimilation”. Vegetation-related data comprise fresh and dry biomass (green and brown, predominantly per organ), plant height, green and brown leaf area index, phenological development state, nitrogen and carbon content (overall \&gt;\&thinsp;17\&thinsp;000 entries), and masses of harvest residues and regrowth of vegetation after harvest or before planting of the main crop (\&gt;\&thinsp;250 entries). Vegetation data including LAI were collected in frequencies of 1 to 3 weeks in the years 2015 until 2017, mostly during overflights of the Sentinel 1 and Radarsat 2 satellites. In addition, fluxes of carbon, energy, and water (\&gt;\&thinsp;180\&thinsp;000 half-hourly records) measured using the eddy covariance technique are included. Three flux time series have simultaneous data from two different heights. Data on agricultural management include sowing and harvest dates as well as information on cultivation, fertilization, and agrochemicals (27 management periods). The dataset also includes gap-filled weather data (\&gt;\&thinsp;200\&thinsp;000 hourly records) and soil parameters (particle size distributions, carbon and nitrogen content; \&gt;\&thinsp;800 records). These data can also be useful for development and validation of remote-sensing products. The dataset is hosted at the TR32 database (https://www.tr32db.uni-koeln.de/data.php?dataID=1889, last access: 29 September 2020) and has the DOI https://doi.org/10.5880/TR32DB.39 (Reichenau et al., 2020).},

However, there is still a lack of high-quality, large-scale EO datasets for training robust networks. This paper presents AgriSen-COG, a large-scale benchmark dataset for crop type mapping based on Sentinel-2 data. AgriSen-COG deals with the challenges of remote sensing (RS) datasets. First, it includes data from five different European countries (Austria, Belgium, Spain, Denmark, and the Netherlands), targeting the problem of domain adaptation. Second, it is multitemporal and multiyear (2019–2020), therefore enabling analysis based on the growth of crops in time and yearly variability. Third, AgriSen-COG includes an anomaly detection preprocessing step, which reduces the amount of mislabeled information. AgriSen-COG comprises 6,972,485 parcels, making it the most extensive available dataset for crop type mapping. It includes two types of data: pixel-level data and parcel aggregated information. By carrying this out, we target two computer vision (CV) problems: semantic segmentation and classification. To establish the validity of the proposed dataset, we conducted several experiments using state-of-the-art deep-learning models for temporal semantic segmentation with pixel-level data (U-Net and ConvStar networks) and time-series classification with parcel aggregated information (LSTM, Transformer, TempCNN networks). The most popular models (U-Net and LSTM) achieve the best performance in the Belgium region, with a weighted F1 score of 0.956 (U-Net) and 0.918 (LSTM).The proposed data are distributed as a cloud-optimized GeoTIFF (COG), together with a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC), which makes AgriSen-COG a findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) dataset.},

	abstract = {Field boundaries are at the core of many agricultural applications and are a key enabler for the operational monitoring of agricultural production to support food security. Recent scientiﬁc progress in deep learning methods has highlighted the capacity to extract ﬁeld boundaries from satellite and aerial images with a clear improvement from object-based image analysis (e.g. multiresolution segmentation) or conventional ﬁlters (e.g. Sobel ﬁlters). However, these methods need labels to be trained on. So far, no standard data set exists to easily and robustly benchmark models and progress the state of the art. The absence of such benchmark data further impedes proper comparison against existing methods. Besides, there is no consensus on which evaluation metrics should be reported (both at the pixel and ﬁeld levels). As a result, it is currently impossible to compare and benchmark new and existing methods. To ﬁll these gaps, we introduce AI4Boundaries, a data set of images and labels readily usable to train and compare models on ﬁeld boundary detection. AI4Boundaries includes two speciﬁc data sets: (i) a 10 m Sentinel-2 monthly composites for large-scale analyses in retrospect and (ii) a 1 m orthophoto data set for regional-scale analyses, such as the automatic extraction of Geospatial Aid Application (GSAA). All labels have been sourced from GSAA data that have been made openly available (Austria, Catalonia, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Sweden) for 2019, representing 14.8 M parcels covering 376 K km2. Data were selected following a stratiﬁed random sampling drawn based on two landscape fragmentation metrics, the perimeter/area ratio and the area covered by parcels, thus considering the diversity of the agricultural landscapes. The resulting “AI4Boundaries” dataset consists of 7831 samples of 256 by 256 pixels for the 10 m Sentinel-2 dataset and of 512 by 512 pixels for the 1 m aerial orthophoto. Both datasets are provided with the corresponding vector ground-truth parcel delineation (2.5 M parcels covering 47 105 km2), and with a raster version already pre-processed and ready to use. Besides providing this open dataset to foster computer vision developments of parcel delineation methods, we discuss the perspectives and limitations of the dataset for various types of applications in the agriculture domain and consider possible further improvements.

	abstract = {Timely monitoring of crop lands is important in order to make agricultural activities more sustainable, as well as ensuring food security. The use of Earth Observation (EO) data allows crop monitoring at a range of spatial scales, but can be hampered by limitations in the data. Crop growth modelling, on the other hand, can be used to simulate the physiological processes that result in crop development. Data assimilation (DA) provides a way of blending the monitoring properties of EO data with the predictive and explanatory abilities of crop growth models. In this paper, we first provide a critique of both the advantages and disadvantages of both EO data and crop growth models. We use this to introduce a solid and robust framework for DA, where different DA methods are shown to be derived from taking different assumptions in solving for the a posteriori probability density function (pdf) using Bayes’ rule. This treatment allows us to provide some recommendation on the choice of DA method for particular applications. We comment on current computational challenges in scaling DA applications to large spatial scales. Future areas of research are sketched, with an emphasis on DA as an enabler for blending different observations, as well as facilitating different approaches to crop growth models. We have illustrated this review with a large number of examples from the literature.},

Firstly, calibrating the input parameters of a crop growth simulation model based on history observations. Secondly, quantitatively describing the relationship between fields observed data and model simulated data by the cost function of 4DVAR algorithm.

Winter wheat in Beijing is taken as an experimental object.

Many studies have attempted to integrate sequential remotely sensed observations in the dynamical operation of physical models, aiming to improve model performance of LAI estimation by using various data assimilation schemes. In this study, a new data assimilation algorithm is proposed. For this algorithm, the background field of free parameters is constructed according to the ensemble construction scheme of EnKF algorithm, and a cost function is constructed based on the cost function construction strategy in 4DVAR algorithm in order to analyse and update the free parameters. The last updated free parameters are input into the model for LAI estimation until all the observations are assimilated. Additionally, the cost function in data assimilation procedure is optimised using VFSA algorithm. Winter wheat in Beijing in 2002 is selected as the experimental object. The crop growth model CERES-Wheat and the radiative transfer model PROSAIL are coupled in the assimilation process. Sequentially observed NDVI of winter wheat are assimilated into the coupled model using different assimilation algorithms to quantitatively compare and analyse the LAI estimation results. The performance of the new algorithm is better than CERES-Wheat model, EnKF algorithm, and 4DVAR algorithm, with a lesser RMSE by 43.68\%, 41.67\%, and 28.99\%, respectively, and with increased R2 by 110.53\%, 90.48\%, and 33.33\%, respectively.

	abstract = {The scale mismatch between remote sensing observations and state variables simulated by crop growth models decreases the reliability of crop yield estimates. To overcome this problem, we implemented a two-step data-assimilation approach: first, we generated a time series of 30-m-resolution leaf area index (LAI) by combining Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and three Landsat TM images with a Kalman filter algorithm (the synthetic KF LAI series); second, the time series were assimilated into the WOFOST crop growth model to generate an ensemble Kalman filter LAI time series (the EnKF-assimilated LAI series). The synthetic EnKF LAI series then drove the WOFOST model to simulate winter wheat yields at 1-km resolution for pixels with wheat fractions of at least 50\%. The county-level aggregated yield estimates were compared with official statistical yields. The synthetic KF LAI time series produced a more realistic characterization of LAI phenological dynamics. Assimilation of the synthetic KF LAI series produced more accurate estimates of regional winter wheat yield (R2=0.43; root-mean-square error (RMSE)=439kgha−1) than three other approaches: WOFOST without assimilation (determination coefficient R2=0.14; RMSE=647kgha−1), assimilation of Landsat TM LAI (R2=0.37; RMSE=472kgha−1), and assimilation of S-G filtered MODIS LAI (R2=0.49; RMSE=1355kgha−1). Thus, assimilating the synthetic KF LAI series into the WOFOST model with the EnKF strategy provides a reliable and promising method for improving regional estimates of winter wheat yield.},

	abstract = {Assimilating remote sensing data with crop growth model is a promising method to estimate crop yields over a large area. However, the method is always subject to the problems with biases in remote sensing products and assimilation weights in practical applications. In this study, we demonstrated the robustness of a ‘spatial assimilation’ method in dealing with the biases in three different remote sensing leaf area index (LAI) products. We further explored assimilation strategies for determining the assimilation weights when using ‘spatial assimilation’ method. Three different remote sensing LAI products were assimilated with MCWLA-Wheat model in the North China Plain during 2008–2015. The results demonstrated that the ‘spatial assimilation’ method was robust in mitigating the influences of biased LAI values and easily coupled with various LAI products based on different sources and retrieving algorithms. Furthermore, we found that the historical experiences of the optimal assimilation weights were not suitable to directly drive data assimilation in the coming seasons. Thus data-assimilation strategies to estimate crop yields without prior knowledge on the optimal assimilation weights were investigated. Two ensemble-mean-based assimilation strategies were recommended, which could reach 84 {\textasciitilde} 98\% of yield estimation accuracy using the optimal assimilation weights. This study provides reliable and promising solutions for yield estimation over a large area using data assimilation without being limited by the biased state variables in remote sensing products and the lack of prior knowledge on the optimal assimilation weights. The ‘spatial assimilation’ method and the proposed ensemble-mean-based assimilation strategies have great potentials for wide applications, laying solid foundations for developing crop growth monitoring and yield forecasting system.},

This paper reviews the important results from these studies and also presents new ideas and alternative interpretations which further explain the success of the EnKF. In addition to providing the theoretical framework needed for using the EnKF, there is also a focus on the algorithmic formulation and optimal numerical implementation. A program listing is given for some of the key subroutines. The paper also touches upon speciﬁc issues such as the use of nonlinear measurements, in situ proﬁles of temperature and salinity, and data which are available with high frequency in time. An ensemble based optimal interpolation (EnOI) scheme is presented as a cost-eﬀective approach which may serve as an alternative to the EnKF in some applications. A fairly extensive discussion is devoted to the use of time correlated model errors and the estimation of model bias.},

	abstract = {The future German Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) mission, due to launch in late 2019, will deliver high resolution hyperspectral data from space and will thus contribute to a better monitoring of the dynamic surface of the earth. Exploiting the satellite’s ±30° across-track pointing capabilities will allow for the collection of hyperspectral time-series of homogeneous quality. Various studies have shown the possibility to retrieve geo-biophysical plant variables, like leaf area index (LAI) or leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), from narrowband observations with fixed viewing geometry by inversion of radiative transfer models (RTM). In this study we assess the capability of the well-known PROSPECT 5B + 4SAIL (Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) RTM to estimate these variables from off-nadir observations obtained during a field campaign with respect to EnMAP-like sun–target–sensor-geometries. A novel approach for multiple inquiries of a large look-up-table (LUT) in hierarchical steps is introduced that accounts for the varying instances of all variables of interest. Results show that anisotropic effects are strongest for early growth stages of the winter wheat canopy which influences also the retrieval of the variables. RTM inversions from off-nadir spectra lead to a decreased accuracy for the retrieval of LAI with a relative root mean squared error (rRMSE) of 18\% at nadir vs. 25\% (backscatter) and 24\% (forward scatter) at off-nadir. For LCC estimations, however, off-nadir observations yield improvements, i.e., rRMSE (nadir) = 24\% vs. rRMSE (forward scatter) = 20\%. It follows that for a variable retrieval through RTM inversion, the final user will benefit from EnMAP time-series for biophysical studies regardless of the acquisition angle and will thus be able to exploit the maximum revisit capability of the mission.},

	abstract = {Quantitative equivalent water thickness on canopy level (EWTcanopy) is an important land surface variable and retrieving EWTcanopy from remote sensing has been targeted by many studies. However, the effect of radiative penetration into the canopy has not been fully understood. Therefore, in this study the Beer-Lambert law is applied to inversely determine water content information in the 930 to 1060 nm range of canopy reflectance from measured winter wheat and corn spectra collected in 2015, 2017, and 2018. The spectral model was calibrated using a look-up-table (LUT) of 50,000 PROSPECT spectra. Internal model validation was performed using two leaf optical properties datasets (LOPEX93 and ANGERS). Destructive in-situ measurements of water content were collected separately for leaves, stalks, and fruits. Correlation between measured and modelled water content was most promising for leaves and ears in case of wheat, reaching coefficients of determination (R2) up to 0.72 and relative RMSE (rRMSE) of 26\% and in case of corn for the leaf fraction only (R2 = 0.86, rRMSE = 23\%). These findings indicate that, depending on the crop type and its structure, different parts of the canopy are observed by optical sensors. The results from the Munich-North-Isar test sites indicated that plant compartment specific EWTcanopy allows us to deduce more information about the physical meaning of model results than from equivalent water thickness on leaf level (EWT) which is upscaled to canopy water content (CWC) by multiplication of the leaf area index (LAI). Therefore, it is suggested to collect EWTcanopy data and corresponding reflectance for different crop types over the entire growing cycle. Nevertheless, the calibrated model proved to be transferable in time and space and thus can be applied for fast and effective retrieval of EWTcanopy in the scope of future hyperspectral satellite missions.},

	abstract = {Decades after release of the first PROSPECT + SAIL (commonly called PROSAIL) versions, the model is still the most famous representative in the field of canopy reflectance modelling and has been widely used to obtain plant biochemical and structural variables, particularly in the agricultural context. The performance of the retrieval is usually assessed by quantifying the distance between the estimated and the in situ measured variables. While this has worked for hundreds of studies that obtained canopy density as a one-sided Leaf Area Index (LAI) or pigment content, little is known about the role of the canopy geometrical properties specified as the Average Leaf Inclination Angle (ALIA). In this study, we exploit an extensive field dataset, including narrow-band field spectra, leaf variables and canopy properties recorded in seven individual campaigns for winter wheat (4x) and silage maize (3x). PROSAIL outputs generally did not represent field spectra well, when in situ variables served as input for the model. A manual fitting of ALIA and leaf water (EWT) revealed significant deviations for both variables (RMSE = 14.5°, 0.020 cm) and an additional fitting of the brown leaf pigments (Cbrown) was necessary to obtain matching spectra at the near infrared (NIR) shoulder. Wheat spectra tend to be underestimated by the model until the emergence of inflorescence when PROSAIL begins to overestimate crop reflectance. This seasonal pattern could be attributed to an attenuated development of ALIAopt compared to in situ measured ALIA. Segmentation of nadir images of wheat was further used to separate spectral contributors into dark background, ears and leaves + stalks. It could be shown that the share of visible fruit ears from nadir view correlates positively with the deviations between field spectral measurement and PROSAIL spectral outputs (R² = 0.78 for aggregation by phenological stages), indicating that retrieval errors increase for ripening stages. An appropriate model parameterization is recommended to assure accurate retrievals of biophysical and biochemical products of interest. The interpretation of inverted ALIA as physical leaf inclinations is considered unfeasible and we argue in favour of treating it as a free calibration parameter.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty in spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall in regional crop yield simulations comprises a major fraction of the error on crop model simulation results. In this paper we used an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to assimilate coarse resolution satellite microwave sensor derived soil moisture estimates (SWI) for correcting errors in the water balance of the world food studies (WOFOST) crop model. Crop model simulations with the EnKF for winter wheat and grain maize were carried out for Spain, France, Italy and Germany for the period 1992–2000. The results were evaluated on the basis of regression with known crop yield statistics at national and regional level. Moreover, the EnKF filter innovations were analysed to see if any systematic trends could be found that could indicate deficiencies in the WOFOST water balance. Our results demonstrate that the assimilation of SWI has clearly improved the relationship with crop yield statistics for winter wheat for the majority of regions (66\%) where a relationship could be established. For grain maize the improvement is less evident because improved relationships could only be found for 56\% of the regions. We suspect that partial crop irrigation could explain the relatively poor results for grain maize, because irrigation is not included in the model. Analyses of the filter innovations revealed spatial and temporal patterns, while the distribution of normalised innovations is not Gaussian and has a non-zero mean indicating that the EnKF performs suboptimal. The non-zero mean is caused by differences in the mean value of the forecasted and observed soil moisture climatology, while the excessive spread in the distribution of normalised innovations indicates that the error covariances of forecasts and observations have been underestimated. These results clearly indicate that additional sources of error need to be included in the simulations and observations.},

	abstract = {The crop model (PyWOFOST) which coupled remote sensing information and a crop model (WOFOST) with Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) was used to simulate maize growth and yield in Northeastern China with MODIS LAI as the coupling point. The assimilation plan focused on analyzing the impact of uncertainties of remote sensing observations (MODIS LAI) and crop model parameters (thermal time from emergence to anthesis, TSUM1) on the modeling results. First, the PyWOFOST model is used to simulate the maize LAI, yield and growth duration at site's scale; then the impact of remote sensing and crop model uncertainties on crop growth simulation is analyzed; finally, the regional maize yield is estimated with the PyWOFOST model, and the results are verified using the maize statistical yield. Results show that the simulated maize yield with assimilation has significantly improved compared to the one without assimilation. Under a business-as-usual scenario, the modeling results without assimilation has an error of 14.04\%. The assimilated results show errors of 12.71\%, 11.91\%, 10.44\%, and 10.48\% at different TSUM1 uncertainty levels at 0, 10, 20, and 30°C, respectively. The simulated LAI with assimilation agree better with the field observations than the one without assimilation. Without assimilation, the simulated growth duration has a mean deviation from the observed results at 3.4 days; with assimilation, the deviation would be 3.5, 4.3, 5.0, and 5.5 days respectively at different TSUM1 uncertainty levels. The results show that the errors for 58.82\% areas are smaller than 15\%. The simulated and statistical yields are highly correlated (R=0.875), and the determination coefficient is at 0.806. The study shows that it is applicable to simulate crop growth using a crop model assimilated with remote sensing data based on EnKF and it is significant to estimate the remote sensing and crop model uncertainties in crop yield estimation.},

	abstract = {To improve the prediction of crop yields at an aggregate scale, we developed a data assimilation-crop modeling framework that incorporates remotely sensed soil moisture and leaf area index (LAI) into a crop model using sequential data assimilation. The core of the framework is an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) used to control crop model runs, assimilate remote sensing (RS) data and update model state variables. We modified the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer – Cropping System Model (DSSAT-CSM)-Maize model (Jones et al., 2003) to be able to stop and start simulations at any given time in the growing season, such that the EnKF can update model state variables as RS data become available. The data assimilation-crop modeling framework was evaluated against 2003–2009 maize yields in Story County, Iowa, USA, assimilating AMSR-E soil moisture and MODIS-LAI data independently and simultaneously. Assimilating LAI or soil moisture independently slightly improved the correlation of observed and simulated yields (R=0.51 and 0.50) compared to no data assimilation (open-loop; R=0.47) but prediction errors improved with reductions in MBE and RMSE by 0.5 and 0.5Mgha−1 respectively for LAI assimilation while these were reduced by 1.8 and 1.1Mgha−1 for soil moisture assimilation. Yield correlation improved more when both soil moisture and LAI were assimilated (R=0.65) suggesting a cause–effect interaction between soil moisture and LAI, prediction errors (MBE and RMSE) were also reduced by 1.7 and 1.8Mgha−1 with respect to open-loop simulations. Results suggest that assimilation of LAI independently might be preferable when conditions are extremely wet while assimilation of soil moisture+LAI might be more suitable when conditions are more nominal. AMSR-E soil moisture tends to be more biased under the presence of high vegetation (i.e., when crops are fully developed) and that updating rootzone soil moisture by near-surface soil moisture assimilation under very wet conditions could increase the modeled percolation causing excessive nitrogen (N) leaching hence reducing crop yields even with water stress reduced at a minimum due to soil moisture assimilation. However, applying the data assimilation-crop modeling framework strategically by considering a-priori information on climate condition expected during the growing season may improve yield prediction performance substantially, in our case with higher correlation (R=0.80) and more reductions in MBE and RMSE (2.5 and 3.3Mgha−1) compared to when there is no data assimilation. Scaling AMSR-E soil moisture to the climatology of the model did not improve our data assimilation results because the model is also biased. Better soil moisture products e.g., from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, may solve the soil moisture data issue in the near future.},

In the present study, leaf photosynthetic traits for top and bottom canopy leaves, canopy structure and light profiles, were measured over one growing season for two contrasting crop types, winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and rape seed (Brassica napus L.). With the exception of quantum yield, other traits such as maximum photosynthetic capacity (Amax), dark respiration, leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll contents, and leaf mass per area, showed consistently higher (P {\textless} 0.05) values for top leaves throughout the growing season and for both crop types. Even though Amax was higher for top leaves, the bottom half of the canopy intercepted more light and thus contributed the most to total canopy photosynthesis up until senescence set in. Incorporating this knowledge into a simple top/bottom-leaf upscaling scheme, separating top and bottom leaves, resulted in a better match between estimated and measured total canopy photosynthesis, compared with a one-leaf upscaling scheme. Moreover, aggregating to daily and weekly temporal resolutions progressively increased the linearity of the leaf photosynthetic responses to light for top leaves.},

	abstract = {The environmental constraints to agriculture imply that nitrogen (N) fertilizer management should be adjusted to crop N requirements determined by target yields. Nowadays for environmental and economical reasons target yield of farmers can be lower than the potential crop yields as permitted by soil and climatic conditions. So it is important to provide farmers crop N status diagnostic tools in order to decide the rate and the timing of N fertilizer applications. Theory on crop N uptake and allocation allows the determination of a diagnostic tool, the Nitrogen Nutrition Index, based on the determination of the critical N dilution curve for each crop species considered. During the vegetative growth period of all the crop species studied, including C3 and C4 species and monocots and dicots, plant N concentration decreases monotonically as crop grows because of (i) the ontogenetic decline in leaf area per unit of plant mass, and (ii) the remobilisation of N from shaded leaves at the bottom of the canopy to well illuminated leaves at the top. NNI appears then as an indicator well connected with the physiological regulation of N uptake at canopy level. So this indicator can be used as the basis for determination of crop N nutrition status, and then for decision making on the necessity of an N application for achieving target yield. Nevertheless despite its high physiological relevance, NNI cannot be used directly in farm conditions because its determination is very time consuming. So it is necessary to develop indirect methods for NNI estimation through more operational procedures. Several methods have been proposed in literature, such as nitrate concentration in sap or chlorophyll meter. But the calibration or validation of these methods with NNI have not been always made and, when they have been, they did not give univocal relationships, showing a strong dependence of the relationship with cultivar and environment, that limits considerably the relevance of such diagnostic tools in a large range of situations. Easier to use is the indirect estimation of crop NNI by remote sensing measurements. This method allows the estimation of both actual crop mass, through LAI estimation and crop N content, through crop chlorophyll content. The possibility to have repeated estimations of crop NNI during the period of vegetative growth would allow a dynamic diagnostic tool of crop N status. The coupling of indirect measurements of crop N status with dynamic models of crop growth and development should allow a very promising method for crop N diagnostics for decision tools in N fertilization.},

	abstract = {An explicit analytical model for calculating vegetation canopy reflectance, the multiple-layer canopy radiative transfer model (MRTM), has been developed in this paper. The model is based on radiative transfer theory by separating the roles of incident direct and diffuse radiation and radiation singly and multiply scattered by foliage. Specifically, the vertical heterogeneity of biophysical and biochemical parameters within the canopy was carefully treated in the model. This model was validated with field measurements from a deciduous forest canopy. The results proved that the model could reproduce the measured reflectance quite well. In addition, the performance of MRTM was found to be superior in comparison to other canopy models such as PROSAIL, ACRM and FRT. The significant effect of vertical heterogeneity on the canopy reflectance was clearly identified by different scenarios, which indicates that the influence of vertical variation in leaf area density and leaf chlorophyll, water, and dry matter contents cannot be neglected, especially when the total LAI is large. If such influences are ignored, significant biases in the estimated canopy reflectance can be expected. Since this multiple-layer model is a hybrid one that offers efficient calculation, it could serve as a primary model to develop more accurate reflectance models for inhomogeneous forests at plot and regional scales in future studies.},

The correlation of leaf positions in adjacent layers significantly influences the gap probability in a stand and, consequently, the canopy reflectance (CR) and its angular distribution. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the effect is greatest on the angular distribution of multiply scattered radiation. Validation of the new CR model that considers the Markov stand geometry demonstrated an improved agreement between model calculations and measured directional reflectance distribution of near infrared (NIR) reflectance for barley and soybean stands. As a consequence, inversion of the new model in the NIR spectral region and in two spectral bands simultaneously allowed significantly better estimation of the leaf area index of a stand than the Nilson-Kuusk model which assumes a Poisson stand geometry.},

	abstract = {How plants interact with sunlight is central to the existence of life and provides a window to the functioning of ecosystems. Although the basic properties of leaf spectra have been known for decades, interpreting canopy-level spectra is more challenging because leaf-level effects are complicated by a host of stem- and canopy-level traits. Progress has been made through empirical analyses and models, although both methods have been hampered by a series of persistent challenges. Here, I review current understanding of plant spectral properties with respect to sources of uncertainty at leaf to canopy scales. I also discuss the role of evolutionary convergence in plant functioning and the difficulty of identifying individual properties among a suite of interrelated traits. A pattern that emerges suggests a synergy among the scattering effects of leaf-, stem- and canopy-level traits that becomes most apparent in the near-infrared (NIR) region. This explains the widespread and well-known importance of the NIR region in vegetation remote sensing, but presents an interesting paradox that has yet to be fully explored: that we can often gain more insight about the functioning of plants by examining wavelengths that are not used in photosynthesis than by examining those that are.

	abstract = {In order to calculate the actual erosion according to the universal soil loss equation (USLE) and to estimate the impact of land use on soil erosion it is important to know the C-factor. Based on the USLE crop-growth stages, the cover-management C-factors were calculated for the main crop rotation systems on arable farms in Belgium with particular reference to those occurring on 40 farms on silt and silt loam soils in the Kemmelbeek watershed, West-Flanders, Belgium. The different rotation systems were composed of the following crops: sugar beet (SB), winter wheat (WW), potato (PO), maize (M), beans (B), winter barley (WB), peas (PE), chicory (CH), leek (L), carrot (CA), celeriac (CE), rye grass (RG) and temporal grassland (TG). The erosivity factor R during the rotation was calculated on the basis of a detailed rainfall time series over a time period of 27 years. The crop data (development of cover, sowing and harvesting date, amount of residue) were collected from literature and personal communications. For most rotation systems the C-factors were between 0.28 and 0.38. High C-factor values were obtained with M/M/M/PO (C=0.47), and with CE/L/PO (C=0.51). Remarkable small C-values (C=0.24–0.27) were found when winter cereals (WW and WB) were put in the rotation scheme. Whether or not the foliage of the sugar beets was removed, had no effect on the C-factor. The effect of green manuring on the C-factor in some rotation schemes was smaller than could be expected. The C-factor was also affected by the position of the crop in the rotation scheme. The calculated C-factors indicated that the application of some rotation systems might cause more erosion by runoff. Therefore, these calculated C-factors can be used as a criterion to select an appropriate rotation system to reduce erosion risk on site. However, validation of these values using experimental field plot data is still required.},

The study was conducted at the Southern part of West Bank, about 10 Km north-west of Hebron city, during 2005, 2006 and 2007. Five treatments were implemented; forests planted with P. halepensis (F), natural vegetation dominated by S. spinosum (W.S), natural vegetation where S. spinosum was removed (W/o.S), cultivated land (C), and deforestation (Df). Three types of data were estimated in each plot: runoff after each rainfall event, sedimentation at the end of the rainy season, and chemical and physical soil properties. The obtained results indicate that there are signiﬁcant and important differences in runoff generation and sediment production with respect to the different types of vegetative cover. Forest and natural vegetation dominated by S. spinosum treatments exhibited the lowest amounts of runoff, with averages of 2.02 and 1.08 mm, respectively, in comparison to other treatments. The removal of S. spinosum signiﬁcantly increased the total amount of runoff and sedimentation compared to the forest and S. spinosum treatments. In addition, runoff signiﬁcantly increased (4.03 mm) for the Df treatment compared to that of the forest site. The greatest amount of sedimentation was observed in cultivated land and with deforestation.},

The relationship between cover and the interception of light by the crop is described by simple theory based on Beer's law and is shown to depend on the ratio of two attenuation coefficients. This ratio is calculated for the case of black leaves using various hypothetical leaf-angle distributions with angular distributions of solar radiation for clear and overcast skies. For black leaves radiation interception is always greater than cover but empirically, foliage cover and interception are almost equal in sugar beet and field beans, and cover is always greater than interception in barley. The value of the ratio may be determined from the measured relationship and used to estimate interception from photographic measurements. Extensions to the technique to measure the effect of environmental stresses in crops are described and the application of the technique to large-scale monitoring of crops is discussed.},

	abstract = {Coupling radiative transfer models for the soil background and vegetation canopy layers is facilitated by means of the four-stream flux interaction concept and use of the adding method. Also the coupling to a state-of-the-art atmospheric radiative transfer model like MODTRAN4 can be established in this way, thus enabling the realistic simulation of top-of-atmosphere radiances detected by space-borne remote sensing instruments. Possible applications of coupled modeling vary from mission design to parameter retrieval and data assimilation. This paper introduces a modified Hapke soil BRDF model, a robust version of the PROSPECT leaf model, and a modernized canopy radiative transfer model called 4SAIL2. The latter is a hybrid two-layer version of SAIL accommodating horizontal and vertical heterogeneities, featuring improved modeling of the hot spot effect and output of canopy absorptances. The integrated model is simply called SLC (soil–leaf-canopy) and has been implemented as a speed-optimized Windows DLL which allows efficient use of computer resources even when simulating massive amounts of hyperspectral multi-angular observations. In this paper various examples of possible model output are shown, including simulated satellite image products. First validation results have been obtained from atmospherically corrected hyperspectral multi-angular CHRIS-PROBA data of the Upper Rhine Valley in Germany.},

Given the current limited knowledge of this issue, this paper investigated the effects of different vertical distributions of crop structure [e.g., leaf angle (LA)] and leaf area index (LAI)] and biochemical parameters [e.g., chlorophyll a and b content (Chla+b) and water content (Wc)] on canopy reflectance and vegetation indices (VIs). A recently developed multiple-layer canopy reflectance model (MRTM) was tested for winter wheat and used to run a simulation analysis of different canopy scenarios. The results showed that the MRTM performed well to model winter wheat canopy reflectance with regard to spikes and vertical distributions of leaf properties. The vertical profiles of LA and LAI influenced canopy reflectance at almost all wavelengths, whereas the vertical profile of Chla+b mainly affected reflectance in the visible region, and that of Wc only affected reflectance in the near-infrared region. Changes in vertical distribution of the LA resulted in clear variations in VIs related to the LA, LAI, and Chla+b estimates. The vertical LAI and Chla+b profiles mainly influenced the VIs related to the LAI and Chla+b estimates. The Wc vertical profile primarily affected the VIs used to estimate crop water properties. The sensitivities of the VIs were mainly associated with the spectral responses and penetration characteristics of the bands they used. These findings suggest that the sensitivity of VIs to the vertical distributions of crop parameters should be considered when establishing models for remote crop monitoring.},

These biophysical variables are produced globally at 10 days temporal sampling interval under lat–lon projection at 1/112° spatial resolution. After a brief description of the VEGETATION sensors, radiometric calibration process, based on vicarious desertic targets is first presented. The cloud screening algorithm was then fine tuned using a global network of cloudiness observations. Atmospheric correction is then achieved using the SMAC code with inputs coming from meteorological values of pressure, ozone and water vapour. Aerosol optical thickness is derived from MODIS climatology assuming continental aerosol type. The Roujean BRDF model is then adjusted for red, near infrared and short wave infrared bands used to the remaining cloud free observations collected over a time window of ±15 days. Outliers due to possible cloud contamination or residual atmospheric correction are iteratively eliminated and prior information is used to get more robust estimates of the three BRDF kernel coefficients. Nadir viewing top of canopy reflectance in the three bands is input to the biophysical algorithm to compute the products at 10 days sampling interval. This algorithm is based on training neural networks over SAIL+PROPSPECT radiative transfer model simulations for each biophysical variable. Details on the way the training data base was generated and the neural network designed and calibrated are presented. Finally, theoretical performances are discussed. Validation over ground measurement data sets and inter-comparison with other similar biophysical products are presented and discussed in a companion paper.

	abstract = {A fractional vegetation cover (FVC) estimation method incorporating a vegetation growth model and a radiative transfer model was previously developed, which was suitable for FVC estimation in homogeneous areas because the finer-resolution pixels corresponding to one coarse-resolution FVC pixel were all assumed to have the same vegetation growth model. However, this assumption does not hold over heterogeneous areas, meaning that the method cannot be applied to large regions. Therefore, this study proposes a finer spatial resolution FVC estimation method applicable to heterogeneous areas using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager reflectance data and Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) FVC product. The FVC product was first decomposed according to the normalized difference vegetation index from the Landsat 8 OLI data. Then, independent dynamic vegetation models were built for each finer-resolution pixel. Finally, the dynamic vegetation model and a radiative transfer model were combined to estimate FVC at the Landsat 8 scale. Validation results indicated that the proposed method (R2 = 0.7757, RMSE = 0.0881) performed better than either the previous method (R2 = 0.7038, RMSE = 0.1125) or a commonly used method involving look-up table inversions of the PROSAIL model (R2 = 0.7457, RMSE = 0.1249).},

Process-based crop models are effective means to project climate impact on crop yield, but have large uncertainty in yield simulations. Here, we show that variations in the mathematical functions currently used to simulate temperature responses of physiological processes in 29 wheat models account for {\textgreater}50\% of uncertainty in simulated grain yields for mean growing season temperatures from 14 °C to 33 °C. We derived a set of new temperature response functions that when substituted in four wheat models reduced the error in grain yield simulations across seven global sites with different temperature regimes by 19\% to 50\% (42\% average). We anticipate the improved temperature responses to be a key step to improve modelling of crops under rising temperature and climate change, leading to higher skill of crop yield projections.},

	abstract = {Northern hemisphere evergreen forests assimilate a significant fraction of global atmospheric CO2 but monitoring large-scale changes in gross primary production (GPP) in these systems is challenging. Recent advances in remote sensing allow the detection of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) emission from vegetation, which has been empirically linked to GPP at large spatial scales. This is particularly important in evergreen forests, where traditional remote-sensing techniques and terrestrial biosphere models fail to reproduce the seasonality of GPP. Here, we examined the mechanistic relationship between SIF retrieved from a canopy spectrometer system and GPP at a winter-dormant conifer forest, which has little seasonal variation in canopy structure, needle chlorophyll content, and absorbed light. Both SIF and GPP track each other in a consistent, dynamic fashion in response to environmental conditions. SIF and GPP are well correlated (R2 = 0.62–0.92) with an invariant slope over hourly to weekly timescales. Large seasonal variations in SIF yield capture changes in photoprotective pigments and photosystem II operating efficiency associated with winter acclimation, highlighting its unique ability to precisely track the seasonality of photosynthesis. Our results underscore the potential of new satellite-based SIF products (TROPOMI, OCO-2) as proxies for the timing and magnitude of GPP in evergreen forests at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution.},

	abstract = {Vegetation productivity metrics such as gross primary production (GPP) at the canopy scale are greatly affected by the efficiency of using absorbed radiation for photosynthesis, or light use efficiency (LUE). Thus, close investigation of the relationships between canopy GPP and photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation is the basis for quantification of LUE. We used multiyear observations over irrigated and rainfed contrasting C3 (soybean) and C4 (maize) crops having different physiology, leaf structure, and canopy architecture to establish the relationships between canopy GPP and radiation absorbed by vegetation and quantify LUE. Although multiple LUE definitions are reported in the literature, we used a definition of efficiency of light use by photosynthetically active “green” vegetation (LUEgreen) based on radiation absorbed by “green” photosynthetically active vegetation on a daily basis. We quantified, irreversible slowly changing seasonal (constitutive) and rapidly day-to-day changing (facultative) LUEgreen, as well as sensitivity of LUEgreen to the magnitude of incident radiation and drought events. Large (2–3-fold) variation of daily LUEgreen over the course of a growing season that is governed by crop physiological and phenological status was observed. The day-to-day variations of LUEgreen oscillated with magnitude 10–15\% around the seasonal LUEgreen trend and appeared to be closely related to day-to-day variations of magnitude and composition of incident radiation. Our results show the high variability of LUEgreen between C3 and C4 crop species (1.43gC/MJ vs. 2.24gC/MJ, respectively), as well as within single crop species (i.e., maize or soybean). This implies that assuming LUEgreen as a constant value in GPP models is not warranted for the crops studied, and brings unpredictable uncertainties of remote GPP estimation, which should be accounted for in LUE models. The uncertainty of GPP estimation due to facultative and constitutive changes in LUEgreen can be considered as a critical component of the total error budget in the context of remotely sensed based estimations of GPP. The quantitative framework of LUEgreen estimation presented here offers a way of characterizing LUEgreen in plants that can be used to assess their phenological and physiological status and vulnerability to drought under current and future climatic conditions and is essential for calibration and validation of globally applied LUE algorithms.},

	abstract = {The Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) has three spectral bands centered at 705, 740, and 783 nm wavelengths that exploit the red-edge information useful for quantifying plant biochemical traits. This sensor configuration is expected to improve the prediction accuracy of vegetation chlorophyll content. In this work, we assessed the performance of several statistical and physical-based methods in retrieving canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) from Sentinel-2 in a heterogeneous mixed mountain forest. Amongst the algorithms presented in the literature, 13 different vegetation indices (VIs), a non-parametric statistical approach, and two radiative transfer models (RTM) were used to assess the CCC prediction accuracy. A ﬁeld campaign was conducted in July 2017 to collect in situ measurements of CCC in Bavarian forest national park, and the cloud-free Sentinel-2 image was acquired on 13 July 2017. The leave-one-out cross-validation technique was used to compare the VIs and the non-parametric approach. Whereas physical-based methods were calibrated using simulated data and validated using the in situ reference dataset. The statistical-based approaches, such as the modified simple ratio (mSR) vegetation index and the partial least square regression (PLSR) outperformed all other techniques. As such the modified simple ratio (mSR3) (665, 865) gave the lowest cross-validated RMSE of 0.21 g/m2 (R2 = 0.75). The PLSR resulted in the highest R2 of 0.78, and slightly higher RMSE =0.22 g/m2 than mSR3. The physical-based approach-INFORM inversion using look-up table resulted in an RMSE =0.31 g/m2, and R2 = 0.67. Although mapping CCC using these methods revealed similar spatial distribution patterns, over and underestimation of low and high CCC values were observed mainly in the statistical approaches. Further validation using in situ data from different terrestrial ecosystems is imperative for both the statistical and physical-based approaches' effectiveness to quantify CCC before selecting the best operational algorithm to map CCC from Sentinel-2 for long-term terrestrial ecosystems monitoring across the globe.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the model SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes), which is a vertical (1-D) integrated radiative transfer and energy balance model. The model links visible to thermal infrared radiance spectra (0.4 to 50 \&mu;m) as observed above the canopy to the fluxes of water, heat and carbon dioxide, as a function of vegetation structure, and the vertical profiles of temperature. Output of the model is the spectrum of outgoing radiation in the viewing direction and the turbulent heat fluxes, photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence. A special routine is dedicated to the calculation of photosynthesis rate and chlorophyll fluorescence at the leaf level as a function of net radiation and leaf temperature. The fluorescence contributions from individual leaves are integrated over the canopy layer to calculate top-of-canopy fluorescence. The calculation of radiative transfer and the energy balance is fully integrated, allowing for feedback between leaf temperatures, leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and radiative fluxes. Leaf temperatures are calculated on the basis of energy balance closure. Model simulations were evaluated against observations reported in the literature and against data collected during field campaigns. These evaluations showed that SCOPE is able to reproduce realistic radiance spectra, directional radiance and energy balance fluxes. The model may be applied for the design of algorithms for the retrieval of evapotranspiration from optical and thermal earth observation data, for validation of existing methods to monitor vegetation functioning, to help interpret canopy fluorescence measurements, and to study the relationships between synoptic observations with diurnally integrated quantities. The model has been implemented in Matlab and has a modular design, thus allowing for great flexibility and scalability.},

	abstract = {Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a radiation flux emitted from chlorophyll molecules and is considered an indicator of the actual functional state of plant photosynthesis. The remote measurement of SIF opens a new perspective to assess actual photosynthesis at larger, ecologically relevant scales and provides an alternative approach to study the terrestrial carbon cycle. Recent studies demonstrated the reliability of measured SIF signals and showed significant relationships between SIF and gross primary production (GPP) at ecosystem and global scales. Despite these encouraging results, understanding the complex mechanisms between SIF and GPP remains challenging before SIF can be finally utilized to constrain estimates of GPP. In this study, we present a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between far-red SIF retrieved at 760nm (SIF760) and GPP, and its transferability across three structurally and physiologically contrasting ecosystems: perennial grassland, cropland and mixed temperate forest. We use multi-temporal imaging spectroscopy (IS) data acquired with the Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) sensor as well as eddy covariance (EC) flux tower data to evaluate the relationship between SIF760 and GPPEC. We use simulations performed with the coupled photosynthesis–fluorescence model SCOPE to prove trends obtained from our observational data and to assess apparent confounding factors such as physiological and structural interferences or temporal scaling effects. Observed relationships between SIF760 and GPPEC were asymptotic and ecosystem-specific, i.e., perennial grassland (R2=0.59, rRMSE=27.1\%), cropland (R2=0.88, rRMSE=3.5\%) and mixed temperate forest (R2=0.48, rRMSE=15.88\%). We demonstrate that asymptotic leaf level relationships between SIF760 and GPPEC became more linear at canopy level and scaled with temporal aggregation. We conclude that remote sensing of SIF provides a new observational approach to decrease uncertainties in estimating GPP across ecosystems but requires dedicated strategies to compensate for the various confounding factors impacting SIF–GPP relationships. Our findings help in bridging the gap between mechanistic understanding at leaf level and ecosystem-specific observations of the relationships between SIF and GPP.},

This opens up opportunities to fully exploit the use of the SIF spectrum as an indicator of photosynthetic activity. Simulations performed with the coupled fluorescence–photosynthesis model SCOPE were used to determine how strongly canopy-leaving SIF can be related to net photosynthesis of the canopy (NPC) for various canopy configurations. Regression analysis between SIF retrievals and NPC values produced the following general findings: (1) individual SIF bands that were most sensitive to NPC were located around the first emission peak (SIFred) for heterogeneous canopy configurations (i.e., varying biochemistry, leaf, canopy variables); (2) using two SIF retrieval bands, e.g. O2-B at 687nm and O2-A at 760nm, or the red and NIR emission peaks at 685nm and 740nm, led to stronger correlations than using only one band; (3) using the O2-B and the O2-A SIF retrieval bands was at least as effective as using the two emission peaks; (4) superior correlations were achieved by using the four main SIF retrieval bands (Hα, O2-B, water vapor, O2-A); and (5) further improvements may be obtained by exploiting the full SIF profile and by using an adaptive, nonlinear regression algorithm such as Gaussian processes regression (GPR). Relationships can be due to variation in photosynthetic capacity (Vcmo), but also from variation in leaf optical and canopy structural variables such as chlorophyll content and leaf area index. Overall, modeling results suggest that sampling the SIF profile in at least both O2-B and O2-A bands enables quantification photosynthetic activity of vegetation with high accuracy.},

	abstract = {The direction of science is often driven by contemporary theory, and theory emerges from consolidated empirical knowledge. What we know emerges from what we explore, and we explore what we have technical tools for. I feel that technical opportunities contributed strongly towards what is held as a contemporary, widely accepted theory. However, the presumed causality may become reverted, if one accounts for those less explored questions, for which tools are missing. Here, I will reflect on decades of research experience in empirical plant sciences, mainly plant water relations, plant carbon relations and biogeography, during which some mainstream paradigms became challenged. Scientific theory passes through waves and cycles and is even linked to fashion. Insight that seemed established at one time may become outdated by novel concepts facilitated by novel methods, and as time progresses, old concepts may find a revival. In the following chapter, I will illustrate such shifts in awareness and misleading paradigms that were driven by the contemporary availability of methods rather than stringent logics. Examples include plant responses to drought stress; the drivers of plant growth in general, as well as in the context of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations; and how physiological plant ecology can contribute to resolving biogeographical questions such as range limits of plant species and plant life forms. My résumé is that explanations of plant responses to the environment are predominantly below ground and require an understanding of developmental and meristematic processes, whereas available tools often lead to attempts at above-ground answers based on primary metabolism (e.g. photosynthesis). Further, well-understood processes at the organ (leaf) level are losing relevance at the community or ecosystem level, where much less understood mechanisms come into action (e.g. stand density control). While the availability of certain convenient methods can open new research arenas, it may also narrow the scope and may direct theory development towards easily measurable parameters and processes.},

	abstract = {Timely availability of weed infestation maps is a key prerequisite for the implementation of site-specific weed management practices. Low-altitude aerial imagery obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has shown significant potential for weed detection in crops. However, most studies focused on wide-spaced row crops such as maize and sunflower and evaluated proposed methods on single or few well-characterized experimental sites at specific points in time representing a limited range of application scenarios. This study evaluated the feasibility of weed detection in on-farm wheat fields characterized by a narrow row spacing, throughout the early and late developmental stages using UAV imagery and ground-based high-resolution imagery. Image data was obtained for nine sites, representing a wide range of management and pedoclimatic conditions. These sites can be seen as a representative sample of scenarios that would be encountered in practice. A high within- and across-site as well as temporal variation was observed for weed infestation levels and weed population species composition, highlighting the need for spatially and temporally resolved weed mapping. Image-based classification of vegetation objects as crop or weed plants was achieved with an accuracy of 0.88 and 0.72 in ground-based high-resolution images and UAV-based aerial images captured from an altitude of 10 m, respectively. The accuracy of pixel-wise, vegetation-index-based weed infestation estimation during the late vegetative stages varied strongly across sites. Our results highlight the critical importance of a high ground resolution for weed detection using object-based image analysis during the critical growth stages of wheat and of robust methods that are applicable across a range of scenarios. This suggested that future research aiming at a rapid implementation of site-specific weed management in wheat should focus on the development of ground-based systems. Yet, aerial monitoring of wheat stands during late developmental stages using currently available equipment offers significant potential for reducing weed pressure with site-specific weed control measures in the context of crop rotations.},

	abstract = {EO based services and related products have been proven to be a stable source of information with reliable quality under varying soil and weather conditions. Information products, like the TalkingFields maps, allow the farmer to more accurately react with site-specific farming techniques. More accuracy means lower production costs, as resources such as water, seeds and fertilizer are not wasted. More accurate also means more efficient in the sense of yield per fertilizer or water used. Last but not least, more accurate also means more sustainable because less fertilizer is leached to the ground water. This benefits on the one side farmers with increased economic profits. On the other side, it also serves natural resource providers such as drinking water suppliers or environmental protection agencies, resulting in both successful commercial business and as well as environmental gains. All in all, smart farming supports ecologically and economically sound agricultural management via site-specific applications – an important step towards sustainable agriculture. Sentinel-2 already marks a huge step towards better spectral coverage and operational availability of satellite data. The free and open access to Sentinel-2 data and infrastructure platforms like FS-TEP will guarantee that these data can be used by everybody around the Globe, no matter whether they are from an industrialized country or a developing country. This gives equal chances to everybody to be more sustainable in agriculture.},

Part of this description also provides an overview of some of the economic barriers and technical obstacles when applying variable-rate application. This chapter also notes that the adoption of several specific variable-rate application technologies have been modest in recent years. However, in contrast the adoption of auto-steering has been significant in the last decade. The last section describes the overall aim of the book and an overview of each chapter in the book. Each chapter address a different topic starting with an overview of technologies that are currently available, followed by specific Variable-Rate Technologies such as VRT fertilizer application, VRT pesticide application, site-specific irrigation management, Auto-steering and Controlled Traffic Systems. Finally, the chapter looks into new developments of autonomous systems with an example of robotic seeding, farm information management in precision agriculture and different methods on the adoption of PA. The last chapter focuses on how PA can fulfil the current policy trends on environmental regulations.},

	abstract = {Site-specific nitrogen (N) management in precision agriculture is used to improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) at the field scale. The objective of this study has been (i) to better understand the relationship between data derived from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform and the crop temporal and spatial variability in small fields of about 2 ha, and (ii) to increase knowledge on how such data can support variable application of N fertilizer in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum). Multi-spectral images acquired with a commercially available UAV platform and soil available mineral N content (Nmin) sampled in the field were used to evaluate the in-field variability of the N-status of the crop. A plot-based field experiment was designed to compare uniform standard rate (ST) to variable rate (VR) N application. Non-fertilized (NF) and N-rich (NR) plots were placed as positive and negative N-status references and were used to calculate various indicators related to NUE. The crop was monitored throughout the season to support three split fertilizations. The data of two growing seasons (2017/2018 and 2018/2019) were used to validate the sensitivity of spectral vegetation indices (SVI) suitable for the sensor used in relation to biomass and N-status traits. Grain yield was mostly in the expected range and inconsistently higher in VR compared to ST. In contrast, N fertilizer application was reduced in the VR treatments between 5 and 40\% depending on the field heterogeneity. The study showed that the methods used provided a good base to implement variable rate fertilizer application in small to medium scale agricultural systems. In the majority of the case studies, NUE was improved around 10\% by redistributing and reducing the amount of N fertilizer applied. However, the prediction of the N-mineralisation in the soil and related N-uptake by the plants remains to be better understood to further optimize in-season N-fertilization.},

	abstract = {Decision-making in breeding increasingly depends on the ability to capture and predict crop responses to changing environmental factors. Advances in crop modeling as well as high-throughput field phenotyping (HTFP) hold promise to provide such insights. Processing HTFP data is an interdisciplinary task that requires broad knowledge on experimental design, measurement techniques, feature extraction, dynamic trait modeling, and prediction of genotypic values using statistical models. To get an overview of sources of variation in HTFP, we develop a general plot-level model for repeated measurements. Based on this model, we propose a seamless step-wise procedure that allows for carry on of estimated means and variances from stage to stage. The process builds on the extraction of three intermediate trait categories; (1) timing of key stages, (2) quantities at defined time points or periods, and (3) dose-response curves. In a first stage, these intermediate traits are extracted from low-level traits’ time series (e.g., canopy height) using P-splines and the quarter of maximum elongation rate method (QMER), as well as final height percentiles. In a second and third stage, extracted traits are further processed using a stage-wise linear mixed model analysis. Using a wheat canopy growth simulation to generate canopy height time series, we demonstrate the suitability of the stage-wise process for traits of the first two above-mentioned categories. Results indicate that, for the first stage, the P-spline/QMER method was more robust than the percentile method. In the subsequent two-stage linear mixed model processing, weighting the second and third stage with error variance estimates from the previous stages improved the root mean squared error. We conclude that processing phenomics data in stages represents a feasible approach if estimated means and variances are carried forward from one processing stage to the next. P-splines in combination with the QMER method are suitable tools to extract timing of key stages and quantities at defined time points from HTFP data.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a boreal ecosystems productivity simulator (BEPS) recently developed at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing to assist in natural resources management and to estimate the carbon budget over Canadian landmass (106–107 km2). BEPS uses principles of FOREST biogeochemical cycles (FOREST-BGC) (Running and Coughlan, 1988) for quantifying the biophysical processes governing ecosystems productivity, but the original model is moth fled to better represent canopy radiation processes. A numerical scheme is developed to integrate different data types: remote sensing data at 1-km resolution in lambert conformal conic projection, daily meteorological data in Gaussian or longitude-latitude grided systems, and soil data grouped in polygons. The processed remote sensing data required in the model are leaf area index (LAI) and land-cover type. The daily meteorological data include air temperature, incoming shortwave radiation, precipitation, and humidity. The soil-data input is the available water-holding capacity. The major outputs of BEPS include spatial fields of net primary productivity (NPP) and evapotranspiration. The NPP calculated by BEPS has been tested against biomass data obtained in Quebec, Canada. A time series o f LAI over the growing season of 1993 in Quebec was derived by using 10-day composite normalized difference vegetation index images acquired by the advanced very high resolution radiometer at 1-km resolution (resampled). Soil polygon data were mosaicked, georeferenced, and rasterized in a geographic information system (ARC/INFO). With the use of the process-based model incorporating all major environmental variables affecting plant growth and development, detailed spatial distributions of NPP (annual and four seasons) in Quebec are shown in this paper. The accuracy of NPP calculation is estimated to be 60\% for single pixels and 75\% for 3×3 pixel areas (9 km9). The modeled NPP ranges from 0.6 kg C/m2/year at the southern border to 0.01 kg C/m2/year at the northern limit of the province. The total annual NPP in Quebec is estimated to be 0.24 Gt C in 1993, which is about 0.3–0.4\% of the global NPP.},

The method was applied to yield estimates from the SUCROS sugar beet model, run for about 50 fields within two sugar factory areas. The assimilation of four to six SPOT and aerial photography data values into the SUCROS model, coupled with the scattering by arbitrarily inclined leaves (SAIL) reflectance model, re-estimated crop establishment and root system settling parameters, to which the model was particularly sensitive. The field-by-field yield estimates were improved (i.e., with remote sensing data assimilation, the relative root mean square error decreased from 20\% to about 10\%). The key factors of the method are the number and timing of images that determine the number and the type of parameters that can be estimated. The main limitation of this method is the lack of robustness of the crop model in simulating LAI in serious drought conditions.},

But, limited information is available. The main objectives of this study were to quantify wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield losses associated with simulated hail damage timing and canopy position. The study was conducted in two locations (Garden City [irrigated], and Manhattan [rainfed]) in Kansas, from 2018 to 2020 and 2016 to 2018, respectively. Treatments were an incomplete factorial combination of stem bending at seven flowering stages, above or below the flag leaf and a nontreated control. Results of the study indicated 11\%–22\% wheat yield reduction due to simulated hail damage above the flag leaf and 32\%–52\% due to hail impact below the flag leaf under irrigated conditions. Within the high-yielding rainfed environment, hail damage caused up to 20\% yield reduction compared with the control. In rainfed and low-yielding environments, the impact of hail damage was mainly dependent on the growth stage of wheat at hail occurrence. Hail damage at Feekes 11.2–11.4 stages decreased yield by 20\%–50\% from the rainfed control. Hail damage at Feekes 10.0–10.5.4 decreased yield by 50\%–70\% from the rainfed control. We provide empirical evidence that indicates hail damage on wheat is dependent on the interaction effect of in-season crop water management, weather, canopy position and crop growth stage, and estimates of yield loss due to hail should consider these factors.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the inversion of foliage Chl vertical-layer distribution by bi-directional reflectance difference function (BRDF) data, so as to provide a theoretical basis for monitoring the growth and development of winter wheat and for providing guidance on the application of fertilizer. Remote sensing could provide a powerful tool for large-area estimation of Chl. Because of the vertical distribution of leaves in a wheat stem, Chl vertical distribution characteristics show an obvious decreasing trend from the top of the canopy to the ground surface. The ratio of transformed chlorophyll absorption reflectance index (TCARI) to optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) was called the canopy chlorophyll inversion index (CCII) in this study. The value of CCII at nadir, ±20 and ±30°, at nadir, ±30 and ±40°, and at nadir, ±50 and ±60° view angles were selected and assembled as bottom-layer Chl inversion index (BLCI), middle-layer Chl inversion index (MLCI), and upper-layer Chl inversion index (ULCI), respectively, for the inversion of Chl at the vertical bottom layer, middle layer, and upper layer. The root mean squared error (RMSE) between BLCI-, MLCI-, and ULCI-derived and laboratory-measured Chl were 0.7841, 0.9426, and 1.7398, respectively. The vertical foliage Chl inversion could be used to monitor the crop growth status and to guide fertilizer and irrigation management. The results suggested that vegetation indices derived from bi-directional reflectance spectra (e.g., BLCI, ULCI, and MLCI) were satisfactory for inversion of the Chl vertical distribution.},

	abstract = {The availability of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 has led to a steady increase in both temporal and spatial resolution of satellite data, offering new opportunities for large-scale crop condition monitoring and crop yield mapping. This study investigated the potential of using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data from the harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) products for crop biomass estimation for six crops in Manitoba, Canada. Crop biomass was estimated using remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) to reparametrize a simple crop growth model. The results showed that the LAI of six different crops can be estimated using a generic relationship between LAI and red-edge based vegetation indices (VIs, e.g., modified simple ratio red-edge (MSRRE) and red-edge normalized difference VI (NDVIRE)) for the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) of Sentinel-2. For the Operational Land Imager of Landsat 8 without the red-edge band, LAI can be best estimated using a VI derived from Near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands (Normalized Difference Water Index, NDWI1). Above-ground dry biomass of these six crops was more accurately estimated from the assimilation of LAI derived from both satellites (R2 (the coefficient of determination) = 0.81, RMSE (the root-mean-square-error) = 135.4 g/m2, nRMSE (the normalized RMSE) = 37.9\%, RPD (the ratio of percent deviation) = 2.26) than that of LAI derived from MSI-data (R2 = 0.80, RMSE = 136.7 g/m2, nRMSE = 38.3\%, RPD = 2.23) or that from LAI derived from OLI-data (R2 = 0.68, RMSE = 191.0 g/m2, nRMSE = 53.5\%, RPD = 1.16). Further analysis showed that these three assimilation cases (MSI and OLI; MSI alone; OLI alone) with a different number of LAI observations resulted in differences in parameter optimization, particularly the parameters relevant to crop phenology and biomass partitioning. Both crop growth stage (e.g., the emergence date for crop growth) and leaf dry biomass estimated from the assimilation of LAI derived from MSI and OLI, or MSI alone, produced the most accurate estimates. These results are likely attributed to the improved temporal coverage associated with Sentinel-2 and the availability of a red-edge band on this sensor.},

	abstract = {Yield development of agricultural crops over time is not merely the result of genetic and agronomic factors, but also the outcome of a complex interaction between climatic and site-specific soil conditions. However, the influence of past climatic changes on yield trends remains unclear, particularly under consideration of different soil conditions. In this study, we determine the effects of single agrometeorological factors on the evolution of German winter wheat yields between 1958 and 2015 from 298 published nitrogen (N)-fertilization experiments. For this purpose, we separate climatic from genetic and agronomic yield effects using linear mixed effect models and estimate the climatic influence based on a coefficient of determination for these models. We found earlier occurrence of wheat growth stages, and shortened development phases except for the phase of stem elongation. Agrometeorological factors are defined as climate covariates related to the growth of winter wheat. Our results indicate a general and strong effect of agroclimatic changes on yield development, in particular due to increasing mean temperatures and heat stress events during the grain-filling period. Except for heat stress days with more than 31°C, yields at sites with higher yield potential were less prone to adverse weather effects than at sites with lower yield potential. Our data furthermore reveal that a potential yield levelling, as found for many West-European countries, predominantly occurred at sites with relatively low yield potential and about one decade earlier (mid1980s) compared to averaged yield data for the whole of Germany. Interestingly, effects related to high precipitation events were less relevant than temperature-related effects and became relevant particularly during the vegetative growth phase. Overall, this study emphasizes the sensitivity of yield productivity to past climatic conditions, under consideration of regional differences, and underlines the necessity of finding adaptation strategies for food production under ongoing and expected climate change.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, encouraging results using radiative transfer model inversion techniques were obtained for land biophysical variables retrieval. However, the inversion of radiative transfer models is a severely ill-posed problem that may lead to significant uncertainties in the biophysical variables estimates. Improvement of performances of the inversion process requires more information to be exploited including better radiative transfer models, exploitation of proper prior information on the distribution of canopy and atmosphere variables, knowledge of uncertainties in satellite measurements, as well as possible spatial and temporal constraints. In this study we focus on the use of coupled atmosphere–surface radiative transfer models (SMAC+SAIL+PROSPECT) to estimate some key biophysical variables from top of atmosphere canopy reflectance data. The inversion is achieved over an ensemble of pixels belonging to a spatial window where aerosol properties are supposed to be constant, and over a temporal window of few days where vegetation state is assumed not to vary. The ensemble inversion scheme accounting for the spatial and temporal constraints is described. Top of atmosphere reflectance observations are simulated for 13 bands within the visible and near infrared domains. The coupled model is inverted with a variational method implementation dedicated to solve very large inverse problems. It is based on the use of the adjoint model and a Quasi-Newton optimisation technique with BFGS update. The multitemporal-patch inversion approach exploiting the spatial and temporal constraints is compared to the classical instantaneous-local inversion applied on single pixel and date. The ‘ensemble’ approach shows significant performance improvements when retrieving aerosol optical thickness τ550 and some canopy characteristics (LAI, LAI×Cab and ALA). Conclusions are drawn on the interest of such approaches, and perspectives are given, with due attention to their applicability within operational algorithms.},

	abstract = {The retrieval of biophysical variables using canopy reflectance models is hampered by the fact that the inverse problem is ill-posed. This leads to unstable and often inaccurate inversion results. In order to regularize the model inversion, a novel approach has been developed and tested on synthetic Landsat TM reflectance data. The method takes into account the neighbouring radiometric information of the pixel of interest, named object signature. The neighbourhood data can either be extracted from gliding windows, already segmented images, or using digitized field boundaries. The extracted radiometric data of the neighbourhood pixels are used to calculate 42 descriptive statistical properties that comprehensively characterize the spectral (co)variance of the image object (e.g. mean and standard deviation of the distributions, intercorrelations between spectral bands, etc.). Together with the habitual spectral signature of the pixel being inverted (6 variables), this object signature (42 variables) is used as input in an artificial neural net to estimate simultaneously three important biophysical variables (i.e. leaf area index, leaf chlorophyll, and leaf water content). The use of neural nets for the model inversion avoids time-consuming iterative optimizations and provides a computational effective way to consider simultaneously pixel and object signatures. In order to “learn” the relation between spectral signatures and biophysical variables, the neural nets were previously trained on large synthetic data sets. The data sets consist of pixel signatures and the corresponding signatures of image objects representing various agricultural fields. The signatures were simulated with the SAILH+PROSPECT canopy reflectance model, assuming largely varying intra- and interfield distributions of the model input parameters. To demonstrate the benefits of the object-based inversion, neural nets were also trained on the pixel signatures alone. For this purpose, the object signatures were simply replaced by randomly generated white noise—all other conditions being the same. The intercomparison based on 30,000 independent validation patterns showed that the proposed method significantly enhances the estimation accuracies: for example, the leaf area index (LAI) is estimated with a percental root mean square error (PRMSE) of 18.3\% (object-based) compared to 25.1\% (pixel based); the corresponding numbers for the leaf chlorophyll content are 12.6\% compared to 15.9\%; for the equivalent leaf water thickness, 10.6\% and 13.9\%, respectively. The benefit of the object signature was strongest for the LAI. Concerning this important biophysical variable, the novel concept accounted for almost one-half of the remaining unexplained variance of the traditional pixel-based approach. Increased accuracies were attributed to the fact that intrafield variations of biophysical canopy variables lead to object signatures that are modulated by the actual average leaf angle (ALA) of the canopy. Since ALA can be considered constant insight given an agricultural field, the concurrent use of pixel and object signatures significantly reduces confounding effects between LAI and ALA typical for traditional inversion approaches. Compared to competing approaches, the algorithm can also be applied to monotemporal imagery and does not require a priori information or the identification of crop type.},

In addition to the comparison of two datasets without and with biological constraints, we also investigated the effects of observation geometry, retrieval method, and wavelength range on estimation accuracy of four crop traits (leaf area index, leaf chlorophyll content, leaf dry matter, and leaf water content) of wheat. The theoretical analysis demonstrated potential advantages of adding biological constraints in synthetic training datasets as well as the capability of deep learning. Additionally, the predictive models were validated on real unmanned aerial vehicle-based multispectral images collected from wheat plots contrasting in canopy structure. The predictive model trained over a synthetic dataset with biological constraints enabled the prediction of leaf water content from using wavelengths in the visible to near infrared range based on the correlations between crop traits. Our findings presented the potential of the proposed conceptual framework in simultaneously retrieving multiple crop traits from canopy reflectance for applications in precision agriculture and plant breeding.},

Yet, for field-derived data, temperature response modelling bears flaws and pitfalls concerning the interpretation of derived parameters. In this study, climate data from five growing seasons with differing temperature distributions served as starting point for a growth simulation of wheat stem elongation, based on a four-parametric temperature response function (Wang–Engel) including all cardinal temperatures. In a novel approach, we re-extracted dose–responses from the simulation by combining high-resolution (hours) temperature courses with low-resolution (days) height data. The collection of such data is common in field phenotyping platforms. To take advantage of the lack of supra-optimal temperatures during the stem elongation, simpler (linear and asymptotic) models to predict temperature response parameters were investigated. The asymptotic model extracted the base temperature of growth and the maximum absolute growth rate with high precision, whereas simpler, linear models failed to do so. Additionally, the asymptotic model provided a proxy estimate for the optimum temperature. However, when including seasonally changing cardinal temperatures, the prediction accuracy of the asymptotic model was strongly reduced. In a field study with three winter wheat varieties, significant differences were found for all three asymptotic dose–response curve parameters. We conclude that the asymptotic model based on high-resolution temperature courses is suitable to extract meaningful parameters from field-based data.},

Similarly, crops of winter wheat sown at widely different dates tend to ripen during the same period of a few days in the following summer. This review, which draws evidence from winter, spring and day-neutral varieties, and from a range of temperate and mediterranean environments, explores the mechanisms leading to this convergence of organ, plant and crop development. Central to these mechanisms are the roles of the environment (temperature, including vernalisation, and photoperiod) in determining the time of initiation of reproductive development (initiation of the collar) and the rates and durations of organ initiation (leaves, tillers, spikelets, florets); however, the mortality of organs, notably tillers and florets, caused by intra- and inter-plant competition also plays a major part in determining the duration of developmental processes and the number of initiated organs which survive. The observed synchrony of crop development cannot be achieved without the coordinated responses of a number of developmental processes (e.g. leaf and ear development) to the environment; how this coordination is achieved by the plant is largely unknown, and in spite of the widespread use of plant growth regulators, molecular aspects of the control of plant development are poorly characterised. In practice, the convergence of development rarely fails, and the few examples of failure of synchrony (e.g. in crops which have lodged or where an inappropriate variety has been used) are reviewed.},

Nevertheless, photoperiod sensitivity and the interaction with vernalization during that phase have not been previously explored under field conditions. Thus, a field study was carried out (i) to assess whether duration of stem elongation is sensitive to photoperiod experienced only during that phase, and if so (ii) to evaluate whether vernalization interacts with this photoperiod response and (iii) to determine if altering duration of stem elongation may influence wheat yield and its components. The experiment was a factorial combination of two vernalization treatments (15 (V15) or 50 (V50) days at 4±1°C and 8h photoperiod), two photoperiod regimes during stem elongation (natural daylength in the field (NP+0) and one daylength extension of 6h (NP+6)) and three cultivars (Buck Manantial (BM), Eureka Ferrocarril Sur (EFS), and ProINTA Puntal (PP)). The stem elongation phase responded to the actual photoperiod experienced during that phase in the three cultivars, increasing its duration with shorter photoperiod. In the vernalization-sensitive cultivars EFS and PP, plants vernalized 50 days showed greater response to photoperiod than those vernalized 15 days. In the most photoperiod-sensitive cultivar (BM), as duration of stem elongation lengthened by exposure to less inductive photoperiod, a higher number of fertile florets at anthesis was achieved leading to an increased grain number and thereby to a higher wheat yield. These results reinforce the idea that a longer duration of stem elongation may offer an alternative avenue to improve yield potential in wheat.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT
Reducing N surplus from agriculture without compromising yield and quality requires economically and ecologically viable solutions.
OBJECTIVE
Based on field data, we investigated a technical and market-based solution to balance the economic and environmental performance of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application in winter wheat in Switzerland.
METHODS
The technical solution, i.e. variable rate (VR) technology, was compared to the standard uniform fertilizer application (ST) in terms of revenues and N balance over seven site-years between 2018 and 2020. The potential of a market-based solution to align revenues and N surplus was investigated based on the relationship between two indicators: the economic optimum (EO) of the revenues and the balanced N supply (BNS). The EO was estimated using a production function approach. The BNS was empirically defined as the point at which the N surplus estimated from total N input (N fertilizer + soil N supply) reaches a limit value of 30 kg N ha−1.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
On average, the revenues of VR were about 4\% higher than in ST. The N surplus was, on average, 32\% (21 kg N ha−1) lower in VR compared with ST due to a 13\% reduction in N inputs with no significant differences in yield. Despite the differences across years and fields, VR appeared to be reducing N surplus without losses in revenues in 5 out of 7 site-years. The revenue curve reached an EO at total N input of 205, 249 and 246 kg N ha−1, in the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. The BNS was calculated at 220, 195, and 178 kg N ha−1 N inputs for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. The results show that a price increase of up to 5.4 times the current fertilizer price through taxes would be necessary in order to reduce the N surplus to an environmentally friendly level. Such an increase would hardly be politically feasible.
SIGNIFICANCE
The reported data showed that VR technology appears as a viable solution for producing lower N surplus at comparable revenue levels, thereby making it an option for small- to medium-scale winter wheat production in Switzerland. The environmental benefit could encourage the financial support of technologies for precise N management, which are often too expensive for these systems. Future research should verify or extend the numeric values found in this study.},

Previous studies focused mainly on extracting phenological metrics (e.g., the start of season, and end of season) from time-series remote sensing data for a complete growing season. The existing NRT crop phenology detection methods are difficult to implement at the sub-field scale using available high spatial resolution satellite datasets with a low temporal resolution. In addition, these existing approaches can only estimate specific phenological events from the remote sensing perspective, which is different from the commonly used Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt and CHemical Industry (BBCH) scale used in crop phenology. In this study, an NRT phenology framework was proposed to detect and forecast phenology for winter wheat and corn from Sentinel-2 time-series data in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. The framework incorporated both the canopy structure dynamics model (CSDM) and the shape model-fitting approach to capture crop growth of development over time. The framework can be performed in NRT using timely available Sentinel-2 data during the growing season. The day of year (DOY) for each phenological stage and the BBCH scale on a specific date can be obtained. The resultant Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSEs, days) of BBCH scales were less than 2.9 for winter wheat and less than 3.7 for corn. The RMSEs of detected DOY of all the phenological stages were less than 4 days for winter wheat and less than 3.7 days for corn except for the senescence and the end of season (EOS) stage.},

	abstract = {Geospatial co-registration is a mandatory prerequisite when dealing with remote sensing data. Inter- or intra-sensoral misregistration will negatively affect any subsequent image analysis, specifically when processing multi-sensoral or multi-temporal data. In recent decades, many algorithms have been developed to enable manual, semi- or fully automatic displacement correction. Especially in the context of big data processing and the development of automated processing chains that aim to be applicable to different remote sensing systems, there is a strong need for efficient, accurate and generally usable co-registration. Here, we present AROSICS (Automated and Robust Open-Source Image Co-Registration Software), a Python-based open-source software including an easy-to-use user interface for automatic detection and correction of sub-pixel misalignments between various remote sensing datasets. It is independent of spatial or spectral characteristics and robust against high degrees of cloud coverage and spectral and temporal land cover dynamics. The co-registration is based on phase correlation for sub-pixel shift estimation in the frequency domain utilizing the Fourier shift theorem in a moving-window manner. A dense grid of spatial shift vectors can be created and automatically filtered by combining various validation and quality estimation metrics. Additionally, the software supports the masking of, e.g., clouds and cloud shadows to exclude such areas from spatial shift detection. The software has been tested on more than 9000 satellite images acquired by different sensors. The results are evaluated exemplarily for two inter-sensoral and two intra-sensoral use cases and show registration results in the sub-pixel range with root mean square error fits around 0.3 pixels and better.},

	abstract = {Advances in the capabilities of commercial CubeSat constellations have enabled the retrieval of multi-spectral surface reflectance data over the Earth’s terrestrial surfaces on an almost daily basis. For example, while the earliest versions of Planet’s CubeSats provided tri-band and then quad-band optical image data, the most recent iterations deliver imaging capabilities with eight unique spectral bands for Earth system monitoring. To determine the utility of these rich geospatial data collections for a range of applications, it is necessary to characterise their radiometric accuracy. Leveraging on-ground spectroradiometer measurements of radiometrically pseudo-invariant features, we assess the absolute accuracy of an annual sequence of Planet SuperDove surface reflectance data. Date-coincident and spectrally overlapping Sentinel-2 image data were also used to assess the relative radiometric accuracy of the CubeSat reflectance data. Additionally, confidence levels for acquiring consistent SuperDove surface reflectance data were calculated, and the multi-temporal patterns of surface reflectance between the SuperDove and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance products were evaluated by examining their rank correlation. Our findings demonstrate that (1) the average accuracy of the Coastal-Blue, Blue, Green I, and Green II SuperDove surface reflectance bands was 5\% higher than for the Yellow, Red, Red-Edge, and Near-Infrared bands; (2) the SuperDove surface reflectance data was on average almost identical to the surface reflectance derived from the coincident Sentinel-2 data; and (3) the radiometric accuracies (i.e., mean errors) can be improved by using band combinations (e.g. normalised difference vegetation index). However, due to the different radiometric performance between the spectral bands, some vegetation indices (e.g. the Yellowness Index) did not provide a linear relationship between the SuperDove and reference data. The probability of acquiring surface reflectance data with less than 5\% reflectance variation was approximately 90\% for the annual multi-satellite dataset. On average, 68\% of the data derived from a single satellite had at least 95\% probability of acquiring surface reflectance with less than 5\% variation. The time series patterns of the SuperDove reflectance data had an average rank correlation coefficient of 0.67 for all types of surface units and 0.77 for vegetated surfaces when compared with the spectrally overlapping bands of the Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data. In addition to providing confidence levels for users to directly assess the radiometric accuracies of SuperDove surface reflectance products, we also provide suggestions to improve the data quality from an end-user’s perspective.},

	abstract = {To predict regional-scale winter wheat yield, we developed a crop model and data assimilation framework that assimilated leaf area index (LAI) derived from Landsat TM and MODIS data into the WOFOST crop growth model. We measured LAI during seven phenological phases in two agricultural cities in China’s Hebei Province. To reduce cloud contamination, we applied Savitzky–Golay (S–G) filtering to the MODIS LAI products to obtain a filtered LAI. We then regressed field-measured LAI on Landsat TM vegetation indices to derive multi-temporal TM LAIs. We developed a nonlinear method to adjust LAI by accounting for the scale mismatch between the remotely sensed data and the model’s state variables. The TM LAI and scale-adjusted LAI datasets were assimilated into the WOFOST model to allow evaluation of the yield estimation accuracy. We constructed a four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVar) cost function to account for the observations and model errors during key phenological stages. We used the shuffled complex evolution–University of Arizona algorithm to minimize the 4DVar cost function between the remotely sensed and modeled LAI and to optimize two important WOFOST parameters. Finally, we simulated winter wheat yield in a 1-km grid for cells with at least 50\% of their area occupied by winter wheat using the optimized WOFOST, and aggregated the results at a regional scale. The scale adjustment substantially improved the accuracy of regional wheat yield predictions (R2=0.48; RMSE=151.92kgha−1) compared with the unassimilated results (R2=0.23; RMSE=373.6kgha−1) and the TM LAI results (R2=0.27; RMSE=191.6kgha−1). Thus, the assimilation performance depends strongly on the LAI retrieval accuracy and the scaling correction. Our research provides a scheme to employ remotely sensed data, ground-measured data, and a crop growth model to improve regional crop yield estimates.},

	abstract = {Crop yield estimation at regional scale using crop model is generally subjected to large uncertainties from insufficient spatial information on heterogeneous growth environment and agronomic management practices. To solve this problem, we assimilated crop phenology and leaf area index (LAI) derived from remote sensing into a crop model (MCWLA-Wheat) to improve its reliability in estimating winter wheat yields at regional scale. Since the LAI magnitude was obviously underestimated however its spatial pattern was relatively well captured by remote sensing, we developed a novel spatial assimilation scheme that assimilated the spatial differences instead of the absolute values of LAI into crop model. Firstly, we retrieved the information of critical development stages of winter wheat from remote sensing data to adjust the simulation of phenology by MCWLA-Wheat model; then the spatial differences of LAI derived from remote sensing were assimilated into the MCWLA-Wheat model using a kind of constant gain Kalman Filter algorithm to improve the ability of the model in estimating winter wheat LAI and yields at regional scale in the North China Plain. This assimilation scheme extracted effective information from remote sensing LAI and meanwhile abandoned the information with obvious errors, ensuring that the assimilation variables could be close to the reality. It avoids the requirement for correction of the LAI derived from remote sensing using other high-quality ancillary data from field measurements. Using this assimilation scheme, the performance of crop model improved substantially. It successfully produced more accurate yield estimates at regional scale during the period of 2001–2008 (mean R2 = 0.42, RMSE = 737/ha) than those without assimilation (mean R2 = 0.26, RMSE = 1012 kg/ha) and those directly assimilating the absolute LAI values derived from remote sensing (mean R2 = 0.30, RMSE = 1257/ha). Our findings demonstrated a reliable and promising assimilation scheme for improving yield estimation of crop model at regional scale with low data requirement.},

	abstract = {Rice yield is an important factor for farmers when reviewing crop management planning and cultivation operations. In previous studies, a non-destructive, labor-saving method has been proposed to determine yield using spectral information from remote sensing. This method assumes that molecule number (e.g., chlorophyll content in leaves) and biophysical information (e.g., leaf area) cause spectral variations. However, spectral information cannot reflect the influence of physiological factors because of the limitations of this method. In this study, we investigated solar radiation use efficiency (RUE), which reportedly reflects physiological changes in crops. Time-series data of leaf area index were collected over five years in rice paddy fields of farmers to calculate and investigate the variation in RUE. The results showed that RUE varied among the survey points but did not differ significantly by year. The mean absolute error of yield estimation ranged from 68.2 g m−2 to 102.2 g m−2 depending on the yield estimation method and from 36.8 g m−2 to 454.1 g m−2 depending on the RUE. Among the estimation methods, the highest accuracy was achieved using leaf area dynamics. These results provide insights into both the effectiveness of leaf area dynamics in yield estimation and the potential errors when using remote sensing.},

	abstract = {ESA’s upcoming Sentinel-2 (S2) Multispectral Instrument (MSI) foresees to provide continuity to land monitoring services by relying on optical payload with visible, near infrared and shortwave infrared sensors with high spectral, spatial and temporal resolution. This unprecedented data availability leads to an urgent need for developing robust and accurate retrieval methods, which ideally should provide uncertainty intervals for the predictions. Statistical learning regression algorithms are powerful candidats for the estimation of biophysical parameters from satellite reflectance measurements because of their ability to perform adaptive, nonlinear data fitting. In this paper, we focus on a new emerging technique in the field of Bayesian nonparametric modeling. We exploit Gaussian process regression (GPR) for retrieval, which is an accurate method that also provides uncertainty intervals along with the mean estimates. This distinct feature is not shared by other machine learning approaches. In view of implementing the regressor into operational monitoring applications, here the portability of locally trained GPR models was evaluated. Experimental data came from the ESA-led field campaign SPARC (Barrax, Spain). For various simulated S2 configurations (S2-10m, S2-20m and S2-60m) two important biophysical parameters were estimated: leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and leaf area index (LAI). Local evaluation of an extended training dataset with more variation over bare soil sites led to improved LCC and LAI mapping with reduced uncertainties. GPR reached the 10\% precision required by end users, with for LCC a NRMSE of 3.5–9.2\% (r2: 0.95–0.99) and for LAI a NRMSE of 6.5–7.3\% (r2: 0.95–0.96). The developed GPR models were subsequently applied to simulated Sentinel images over various sites. The associated uncertainty maps proved to be a good indicator for evaluating the robustness of the retrieval performance. The generally low uncertainty intervals over vegetated surfaces suggest that the locally trained GPR models are portable to other sites and conditions.},

	abstract = {One of the most common approaches to reducing the environmental impact of nitrogen (N) fertilisation in intensive agrosystems is to adjust the N input of the crop requirement. This adjustment is frequently related to the nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) based on the concepts of the critical and actual N absorbed (kg/ha) in the crop canopy (respectively, NC and CNC). Accurate estimation of the NC and CNC at the field scale over large areas based on freely available satellite imagery is thus a key issue to address. Relying on a large dataset of farmers' fields, this study highlights the high correlation (R2 = 0.90) between the wheat CNC and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) retrieved from Sentinel-2 (S2) with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The estimation is related to errors of 4 and 21 kg/ha (depending on the growing stage), which is a promising result for evaluating the NNI. There are four major outcomes from this result: (i) the importance of working at the canopy level; (ii) the independence of the relationship to the considered cultivars; (iii) the dependence of the relationship on the growing stage; and (iv) the potential to use only the 10 m S2 bands, opening the way for precision agriculture. In parallel, estimation accuracies were investigated for the three biophysical variables (BV) related to the CNC and NC, i.e., the green area index (GAI), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab) and CCC. From this analysis, the added value of the red-edge bands for improving the estimation of the 3 BVs of interest was quantified as was the performance reduction related to the field heterogeneity.},

Airborne imaging spectrometry was used to generate REP images (units, nm) of the grassland and winter wheat field sites. Strong correlations were observed between REP and canopy chlorophyll concentration at both field sites. Predictive regression equations were developed to map canopy chlorophyll concentration across the field sites. The rms error of estimated chlorophyll concentration was 0.42 mg g−1 (±12.69\% of mean) and 2.09 mg g−1(±16.4\% of mean) at the grassland and winter wheat field sites respectively. Results demonstrated the use of remotely sensed estimates of the REP from both field and airborne spectrometers for estimating chlorophyll concentration and indicated the potential of this technique for inferring both land contamination and grain yield.},

In order to explore and evaluate the per­ formance of different VIs on estimation of the canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) of winter wheat, the published and modified indices were optimized by using the random band combination through original spectrum (OS) and first-order differential (FD) treatment. The results showed that the first derivative processing improved the correlation between the red edge band and winter wheat CCC. The three-band VI can break the restriction of the number of bands on the extraction of target information, relieved the saturation problem of the dual-band VI, and improved the monitoring accuracy of winter wheat CCC. The index 2 × R1-R2-R3 was found to be the best VI for assessing the CCC of winter wheat based on the original and first-order differential spectrum (calibration R2 {\textgreater} 0.733), R2 and RMSE of validation set were 0.688, 0.755 and 1.515, 1.336, respectively. In addition, the index expression formula R1/(R2 × R3) was recommended as a favorable choice for monitoring the agronomic traits of crop. Moreover, the VI is suggested to use at the red edge position band to monitor crop growth indicators. In conclusion, the use of VI can better monitor winter wheat CCC which could provide a theoretical basis for precision agriculture.},

This study tested the hypothesis whether LAI estimation accuracy can be improved by involving LCC information. Firstly, the sensitivities of seven PROSAIL simulated Sentinel-2 bands to LAI and LCC were inves­ tigated, and related vegetation indices (VIs) were constructed using these sensitive bands (including LAI-sensitive VIs and LCC-sensitive VIs). Then, the LAI estimation model taking sensitive VIs as input and LCC estimation model taking sensitive VIs as input were generated by random forest regression algorithm. Finally, the improved LAI estimation model involving LCC information was proposed using three different methods: (1) PROSAIL simulated LCC, (2) simulated LCC with noise, and (3) functional equation of LCC. The results indicated that the three LCC information introducing methods all improved the LAI estimation accuracy, while using the functional equation of LCC (growth equation) performed best with RMSE of 0.736, which is 11.54\% higher when compared to the basic LAI estimation model.},

However, the usability of vegetation indices (VI) for the prediction of crop parameters is strongly limited by the fact that most VI calibrations are only valid for specific crops and growth periods. The results of the presented study based on the differentiation of primary (main driver of the reflectance signal) and secondary (not directly related to reflectance signal) crop parameters. For GAI prediction, a universal (without crop-specific parametrization) simple ratio vegetation index (SR) provided good calibration (­R2 adj. = 0.90, MAE = 0.32, rMAE = 22\%) and evaluation results (MAE = 0.33, rMAE = 18\%). The disentanglement of primary and secondary traits allowed the development of a functional two-step model for the estimation of the N content during vegetative growth (MAE = 19.2 g N m­ −1, rMAE = 44\%). This model was based on fundamental, crop-specific relationships between the crop parameters GAI and N content. Additionally, an advanced functional approach was tested enabling the whole-season prediction of DM and confirming a reliable GAI estimation throughout the whole growing season (­R2 = 0.89–0.93).},

	abstract = {Detailed information on plant developmental stages, referred as phenological phases, can assist research, applications and synergies e.g., in land use, climate science and remote sensing. Usually, detailed ground information about phenological phases is only available as point observations. However, in most application scenarios of spatially interpolated phenological information is required. In this article, we present an approach for modeling and interpolation of crop phenological phases in temperate climates on the example of the total area of Germany using statistical analysis and a Kriging prediction process. The presented model consists of two major parts. First, daily temperature observations are spatially interpolated to retrieve a countrywide temperature data set. Second, this temperature information is linked to the day of year on which a phenological event was observed by a governmental observation network. The accumulated temperature sum between sowing and observed phenological events is calculated. The day on which the temperature sum on any location exceeds a phase-speciﬁc critical temperature sum, which indicates the day of entry of the modeled phase, is ﬁnally interpolated to retrieve a countrywide data set of a speciﬁc phenological phase. The model was applied on the example of eight agricultural species including cereals, maize and root crops and 37 corresponding phases in 2011. The results for most of the tested crops and phases show signiﬁcantly lower root mean squared errors (RMSE) values and higher goodness of ﬁt (R2) values compared to results computed using Ordinary Kriging (OK) and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW). The modeling accuracy varies between 2.14 days and 11.45 days for heading and emergence of winter wheat, respectively. The uncertainty of the majority of the modeled phases is less than a week. The model is universally applicable due to automatic parametrization, but model accuracies depend on the crop type and increase during a growing season. The possibility to enhance the model by additional explaining variables is demonstrated by consideration of soil moisture within an extended model setting.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral data sets contain useful information for characterizing vegetation canopies not previously available from multi-spectral data sources. However, to make full use of the information content one has to find ways for coping with the strong multi-collinearity in the data. The redundancy directly results from the fact that only a few variables effectively control the vegetation signature. This low dimensionality strongly contrasts with the often more than 100 spectral channels provided by modern spectroradiometers and through imaging spectroscopy. With this study we evaluated three different chemometric techniques specifically designed to deal with redundant (and small) data sets. In addition, a widely used 2-band vegetation index was chosen (NDVI) as a baseline approach. A multi-site and multi-date field campaign was conducted to acquire the necessary reference observations. On small subplots the total canopy chlorophyll content was measured and the corresponding canopy signature (450–2500nm) was recorded (nobs=42). Using this data set we investigated the predictive power and noise sensitivity of stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) and two ‘full spectrum’ methods: principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR). The NDVI was fitted to the canopy chlorophyll content using an exponential relation. For all techniques, a jackknife approach was used to obtain cross-validated statistics. The PLSR clearly outperformed all other techniques. PLSR gave a cross-validated RMSE of 51mgm−2 (Rcv2=0.82) for canopy chlorophyll contents ranging between 38 and 475mgm−2 (0.99≤LAI≤8.74m2m−2). The lowest accuracy was achieved using PCR (RMSEcv=82mgm−2 and Rcv2=0.57). The NDVI, even using chlorophyll optimized band settings, could not reach the accuracy of PLSR. Regarding the sensitivity to artificially created (white) noise, PCR showed some advantages, whereas SMLR was the most sensitive chemometric technique. For relatively small, highly multi-collinear data sets the use of partial least square regression is recommended. PLSR makes full use of the rich spectral information while being relatively insensitive to sensor noise. PLSR provides a regression model where the entire spectral information is taken – in a weighted form – into account. This method seems therefore much better adapted to deal with potentially confounding factors compared to any 2-band vegetation index which can only avoid the most harmful factor of variation.},

The approach was (1) to calibrate and validate a reflectance-based non-destructive technique to estimate leaf Chl in maize; (2) to quantify the relative contribution of each leaf Chl to the total Chl in the canopy; and (3) to establish a relationship between leaf Chl content and total Chl in a maize canopy. The Red Edge Chlorophyll Index CIred edge=(RNIR/Rred edge)−1 based on reflectances, R, in the red edge (720–730nm) and near infrared (770–800nm) was found to be an accurate measure of maize leaf Chl. It was able to predict leaf Chl ranging from 10 to 805mgChlm−2 with root mean-square error less than 38mgChlm−2. Relationships between Chl content in each maize leaf and total canopy Chl content were established and showed that Chl in the collar leaf before silking or ear leaves explained more than 80\% and 87\% of the variation in total Chl in a maize canopy, respectively. Thus, non-destructive measurements of both reflectance and area of a single leaf (either collar or ear) can be used to accurately estimate total Chl content in a maize canopy.},

	abstract = {Phenology is one of the most reliable indicators of vegetation dynamics. Assessing and monitoring the dynamics of phenology is relevant to support several decisions in order to improve the efficiency of several farming practices. An open source application – QPhenoMetrics - implemented in QGIS software that estimates vegetation phenology metrics is presented, using Earth Observation Systems (EOS) based time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as proxies for phenology. QPhenoMetrics is characterized by freely-usable and updatable code, acceptance of satellite images or text formats, time-series analysis toolbox allowing the selection of region of interest with statistical quality assessment for Vegetation Indices (VI), and estimation of ensemble metrics. The application is structured in three components: (i) input data; (ii) pre-processing of the VI time-series and several fitting methods and (iii) computation of the phenological metrics. QPhenoMetrics produces a plot with the VI time-series and corresponding phenology metrics, and a spreadsheet is created with a list of NDVI or EVI values estimated using the selected fitting method. To evaluate the application, two main Portuguese crops, vineyards and maize, and MOD13 data from MODIS sensor during 2011–2012 were considered. QPhenoMetrics was validated with vineyard phenology observations (2007–2011). A comparative analysis with software products TimeSat and Spirits was also performed. It was concluded that QPhenoMetrics can be very useful for common users to extract phenology information for 16 daily MODIS data in HDF format, text files with NDVI/EVI data and ASCII files, through a simple and intuitive graphic interface. Furthermore, the user can evaluate the quality assessment of VI of the images used. QPhenoMetrics is an effective open source tool that in addition to being free, is readily modifiable by user according to the study requirements.},

	abstract = {The green leaf area index (GLAI) has been widely used in agriculture, forestry, and environmental sciences for the analysis and modeling of many biophysical processes of vegetation, including the attenuation of light through the canopy, transpiration, photosynthesis, and carbon and nutrient cycles. Nevertheless, its usefulness is hampered by the uncertainty introduced through the lack of quantitative information on leaf biochemistry, particularly leaf chlorophyll content, in its computation. Thus far, this uncertainty has not been properly recognized nor quantified. The main goal of this study was to quantify the uncertainty of GLAI as used in the estimation of key photosynthetic canopy traits, namely canopy chlorophyll content (CCC). This uncertainty was assessed through the evaluation of the relationship between GLAI and CCC in structurally and functionally contrasting crop species (Zea mays L., Glycine max (L.) Merr., and Oryza sativa L). Results show that for the same GLAI value, CCC varied 2- to 3-fold due mainly to the variability of leaf chlorophyll content. Therefore, we suggest using the absorption coefficient in the red-edge region of the electromagnetic spectrum as an alternative to GLAI for the evaluation of CCC and other important photosynthetic canopy traits. The absorption coefficient in this spectral region is particularly suitable as it has been successfully related with the gross primary productivity of vegetation canopies, the quantum yield of photosynthesis, and is sensitive to the repositioning of chloroplasts within leaf cells in response to water stress.},

	abstract = {Life on Earth depends on photosynthesis. Photosynthetic systems evolved early in Earth history, providing evidence for the significance of pigments in plant functions. Photosynthetic pigments fill multiple roles from increasing the range of energy captured for photosynthesis to protective functions. Given the importance of pigments to plant functioning, greater effort is needed to determine and quantify the relationship between gross primary production (GPP) and canopy chlorophyll (Chl) content, the main photosynthetic pigment, as well as its proxy, green leaf area index (GLAI), both used as quantitative measures of plant greenness. The objective of this study is to establish relationships for GPP vs. canopy Chl content and GPP vs. GLAI in maize. The main focus of the paper is to reveal fine details of the relationships and understand their features in different stages of maize development. Data on GPP, leaf Chl content and GLAI were collected across ten years (2001–2010) at three AmeriFlux sites in Nebraska over irrigated and rainfed maize. Relationships of GPP vs. total canopy Chl content and GPP vs. GLAI were established for vegetative, tasseling and reproductive stages. In each stage, relationships were close with determination coefficients above 0.9; however, the shapes and slopes of the relationships in vegetative stages were different from reproductive stages. This difference was more pronounced for the GPP vs. GLAI relationship. In part, this difference is due to different leaf Chl contents in vegetative and reproductive stages. Smaller but detectable differences in shape and slope were also found for the GPP vs. canopy Chl relationship. Despite the differences in relationships for vegetative and reproductive stages, for the entire growing season, green LAI (GLAI) explained 90\% of GPP variation with a coefficient of variation (CV)=17\%, while total canopy Chl content explained more than 92\% of GPP variation with CV=15\%. Quantitative characterization of relationships between GPP and such biophysical characteristics as GLAI and canopy Chl content underlines the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis and has significant implications on remote sensing of primary production.},

	abstract = {Estimation of canopy biophysical variables from remote sensing data was investigated using radiative transfer model inversion. Measurement and model uncertainties make the inverse problem ill posed, inducing difficulties and inaccuracies in the search for the solution. This study focuses on the use of prior information to reduce the uncertainties associated to the estimation of canopy biophysical variables in the radiative transfer model inversion process. For this purpose, lookup table (LUT), quasi-Newton algorithm (QNT), and neural network (NNT) inversion techniques were adapted to account for prior information. Results were evaluated over simulated reflectance data sets that allow a detailed analysis of the effect of measurement and model uncertainties. Results demonstrate that the use of prior information significantly improves canopy biophysical variables estimation. LUT and QNT are sensitive to model uncertainties. Conversely, NNT techniques are generally less accurate. However, in our conditions, its accuracy is little dependent significantly on modeling or measurement error. We also observed that bias in the reflectance measurements due to miscalibration did not impact very much the accuracy of biophysical estimation. D 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Information about pigment and water contents provides comprehensive insights for evaluating photosynthetic potential and activity of agricultural crops. In this study, we present the concept of using spectral integral ratios (SIR) to retrieve three biochemical traits, namely chlorophyll a and b (Cab), carotenoids (Ccx), and water (Cw) content, simultaneously from hyperspectral measurements in the wavelength range 460−1100 nm. The SIR concept is based on automatic separation of respective absorption features through local peak and intercept analysis between log-transformed reflectance and convex hulls. The algorithm was tested on two synthetically established databases using a physiologically constrained look-up-table (LUT) generated by (i) the leaf optical properties model PROSPECT and (ii) the canopy radiative transfer model (RTM) PROSAIL. LUT constraints were realized based on natural Ccx-Cab relations and green peak locations identified in the leaf optical database ANGERS. Linear regression between obtained SIRs and model parameters resulted in coefficients of determi­ nation (R²) of 0.66 (i and ii) for Ccx, R2 = 0.85 (i) and 0.53 (ii) for Cab, and R2 = 0.97 (i) and 0.67 (ii) for Cw, respectively. Using the model established from the PROSPECT LUT, leaf level validation was carried out based on ANGERS data with reasonable results both in terms of goodness of fit and root mean square error (RMSE) (Ccx: R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 2.1 μg cm−2; Cab: R2 = 0.67, RMSE = 12.5 μg cm-2; Cw: R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.007 cm). The algorithm was applied to airborne spectrometric HyMap data acquired on 12th July 2003 in Barrax, Spain and to AVIRIS-NG data recorded on 2nd July 2018 southwest of Munich, Germany. Mapping of the SIR results as multiband images (3-segment SIR) allows for intuitive visualization of dominant absorptions with respect to the three considered biochemical variables. Barrax in situ validation using linear regression models derived from PROSAIL LUT showed satisfactory results regarding Cab (R2 = 0.84; RMSE = 9.06 μg cm-2) and canopy water content (CWC, R2 = 0.70; RMSE = 0.05 cm). Retrieved Ccx values were reasonable according to Cab-Ccx-de­ pendence plausibility analysis. Hence, the presented SIR algorithm allows for computationally efficient and RTM supported robust retrievals of the two most important vegetation pigments as well as of water content and is ready to be applied on satellite imaging spectroscopy data available in the near future. The algorithm is publicly available as an interface supported tool within the 'Agricultural Applications' of the EnMAP-Box 3 hyperspectral remote sensing software suite.},

	abstract = {Satellite-based land surface phenology (LSP) products play an important role in understanding atmosphere-vegetation carbon and energy exchanges. These products have been widely calculated from various satellite observations from local to global scales. However, the quality and accuracy of LSP products are often poorly quantified due to spatial mismatch between satellite observed pixels and in-situ observations. In the present study, we demonstrate an optimal algorithm leveraging the scalability, consistency, and representativeness of rich in-situ observations from national phenology networks to validate LSP products. Specifically, we demonstrate two approaches for validating the phenological timing of greenup onset in the operational Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) LSP product developed at NASA using in-situ observations collected from the Pan European Phenological database (PEP725, 9664 site-years) and the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN, 3144 site-years) spanning 2013–2020. The first approach assumes that in-situ data contain observations of phenological transitions (e.g., leaf-out) that are directly comparable with satellite detections. Accordingly, in-situ data were aggregated using four upscaling methods (mean, median, 30th percentile, and minimum bias) to directly compare with VIIRS LSP. The second approach assumes that species-specific phenological timing in in-situ data is basically impossible to spatially reconcile VIIRS LSP, but phenological events in a local area are driven by the same or very similar weather conditions. Therefore, interannual variations and long-term trends were applied to compare VIIRS LSP with in-situ data. The result shows first that the 30th percentile method is more promising in aggregating in-situ observations than the commonly used mean method. Second, direct comparison indicates that VIIRS greenup onset has a mean absolute difference of 13.9 ± 9.8 days with PEP725 in-situ observations and 12.3 ± 10.9 days with USA-NPN observations in well-selected deciduous forest sites. Third, the interannual comparison reveals that VIIRS greenup onset exhibits the same directions of multi-year anomalies and long-term trends as those of both PEP725 and USA-NPN observations in over 70\% of sample sites. These findings improve our understanding of the scale mismatch and sample representativeness of species-specific phenology and the uncertainties of long-term LSP detections from remote sensing data.},

	abstract = {Vicarious calibration and validation techniques are important tools to ensure the long-term stability and inter-sensor consistency of satellite sensors making observations in the solar-reflective spectral domain. Automated test sites, which have continuous in situ monitoring of both ground reflectance and atmospheric conditions, can greatly increase the match-up possibilities for a wide range of space agency and commercial sensors. The Baotou calibration and validation test site in China provides operational high-accuracy and high-stability vicarious calibration and validation for high spatial resolution solar-reflective remote-sensing sensors. Two sites, given the abbreviations BTCN (an artificial site) and BSCN (a natural sandy site), have been selected as reference sites for the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites radiometric calibration network (RadCalNet). RadCalNet requires sites to provide data in a consistent format but does not specify the required operational conditions for a RadCalNet site. The two Baotou sites are the only sites to date that make spectral measurements for their continuous operation. One of the core principles of RadCalNet is that each site should have a metrologically rigorous uncertainty budget which also describes the site’s traceability to the international system of units, the SI. This paper shows a formalized metrological approach to determining and documenting the uncertainty budget and traceability of a RadCalNet site. This approach follows the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement. The paper describes the uncertainty analysis for bottom-of-atmosphere and top-of-atmosphere reflectance in the spectral region from 400 to 1000 nm for the Baotou sites and gives preliminary results for the uncertainty propagating this to top-of-atmosphere reflectance.},

	abstract = {Approaches from metrology can assist earth observation (EO) practitioners to develop quantitative characterisation of uncertainty in EO data. This is necessary for the credibility of statements based on Earth observations in relation to topics of public concern, particularly climate and environmental change. This paper presents the application of metrological uncertainty analysis to historical Earth observations from satellites, and is intended to aid mutual understanding of metrology and EO. The nature of satellite observations is summarised for different EO data processing levels, and key metrological nomenclature and principles for uncertainty characterisation are reviewed. We then address metrological approaches to developing estimates of uncertainty that are traceable from the satellite sensor, through levels of data processing, to products describing the evolution of the geophysical state of the Earth. EO radiances have errors with complex error correlation structures that are significant when performing common higher-level transformations of EO imagery. Principles of measurement-function-centred uncertainty analysis are described that apply sequentially to each EO data processing level. Practical tools for organising and traceably documenting uncertainty analysis are presented. We illustrate these principles and tools with examples including some specific sources of error seen in EO satellite data as well as with an example of the estimation of sea surface temperature from satellite infra-red imagery. This includes a simulation-based estimate for the error distribution of clear-sky infra-red brightness temperature in which calibration uncertainty and digitisation are found to dominate. The propagation of these errors to sea surface temperature is then presented, illustrating the relevance of the approach to derivation of EO-based climate datasets. We conclude with a discussion arguing that there is broad scope and need for improvement in EO practice as a measurement science. EO practitioners and metrologists willing to extend and adapt their disciplinary knowledge to meet this need can make valuable contributions to EO.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is now commonplace, powering data-driven applications in various organizations. Unlike the traditional perception of ML in research, ML production pipelines are complex, with many interlocking analytical components beyond training, whose sub-parts are often run multiple times on overlapping subsets of data. However, there is a lack of quantitative evidence regarding the lifespan, architecture, frequency, and complexity of these pipelines to understand how data management research can be used to make them more efficient, effective, robust, and reproducible. To that end, we analyze the provenance graphs of 3000 production ML pipelines at Google, comprising over 450,000 models trained, spanning a period of over four months, in an effort to understand the complexity and challenges underlying production ML. Our analysis reveals the characteristics, components, and topologies of typical industrystrength ML pipelines at various granularities. Along the way, we introduce a specialized data model for representing and reasoning about repeatedly run components in these ML pipelines, which we call model graphlets. We identify several rich opportunities for optimization, leveraging traditional data management ideas. We show how targeting even one of these opportunities, i.e., identifying and pruning wasted computation that does not translate to model deployment, can reduce wasted computation cost by 50\% without compromising the model deployment cadence.},

	abstract = {A crop variety test is an important way to evaluate the high yield, adaptability, and resistance of potential crop varieties, and it is the cornerstone of the commercialization of new crop varieties. In China, variety tests are performed on five major crops (rice, wheat, maize, cotton, and soybean) by national or provincial agricultural departments every year. However, a large-scale, high-throughput, widely adaptable, and low-cost information platform that supports the management of all the business processes of crop variety tests is lacking, and thus the development of the crop seed industry in China is restricted. In this study, a cloud-based online information platform called Golden Seed Variety Test Platform (GSVTP) was designed and developed for the management of the national variety test of major crops on the basis of our proposed three-tier browser/server architecture model. The platform provides many functional modules for automatic and intelligent data collection, processing, analysis, and report preparation. The platform has been fully applied to all national-level and some provincial-level variety tests on five major crops in China and has been run safely and stably for more than three years. It is by far the most widely used information platform for variety test management in China, covers all the ecological zones of China’s five major crops, and has the largest number of users. The presented platform has greatly improved the work efficiency and data quality of variety tests and reduced the workload, labor, and materials cost. The successful application of our platform has greatly improved the precision of China’s crop variety test at the management level.},

Three different inversion techniques were applied to explore the impact of the employed method on estimation accuracies: numerical optimization (downhill simplex method), a look-up table (LUT) and an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. By numerical optimization (Num Opt), reliable estimates were obtained for LAI and canopy chlorophyll contents (LAI×Cab) with r2 of 0.85 and 0.94 and RDP values of 1.81 and 2.65, respectively. Accuracies dropped for canopy water (LAI×Cw) and dry matter contents (LAI×Cm). Nevertheless, the range of leaf water contents (Cw) was very narrow in the studied plant material. Prediction accuracies generally decreased in the order Num Opt{\textgreater}LUT{\textgreater}ANN. This decrease in accuracy mainly resulted from an increase in offset in the obtained values, as the retrievals from the different approaches were highly correlated. The same decreasing order in accuracy was found for the difference between the measured spectra and those reconstructed from the retrieved variable values. The parallel application of the different inversion techniques to one collective data set was helpful to identify modelling uncertainties, as shortcomings of the retrieval algorithms themselves could be separated from uncertainties in model structure and parameterisation schemes.},

Matching ‘critical’ phases (when the most important yield components are determined) and best environmental conditions is crucial to maximize yield.

In this chapter, we describe the main developmental stages, delimiting major phenological phases of wheat and soybean, and the relationships between crop phenology, adaptation and yield determination. Analysis of environmental control of development is restricted to the main drivers: temperature, including temperature per se and vernalization (for wheat), and photoperiod. The effects of major genes are outlined: Vrn, Ppd and Eps in wheat and Dt (growth habit) and genes of the series E and J in soybean. Finally, we integrate the environmental and genetic effects on phenology into the determination of crop adaptation and yield potential.},

	abstract = {Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA) are two important traits in measuring biodiversity. To use remote sensing for the estimation of these traits, it is essential to understand the underlying factors that influence their relationships with canopy reflectance. The effect of canopy structures-particularly stem density (SD), leaf area index (LAI), stand height (SH), crown diameter (CD), and average leaf angle (ALA)-on the relationship between LDMC and SLA with the canopy reflectance were investigated using a canopy reflectance dataset simulated by the invertible forest reflectance model (INFORM) radiative transfer model. The parameterization of the model was based on the range of the field parameters collected in the Bavarian National Park in July 2013 and the configuration of the HYSpex hyperspectral sensor. Strong correlations were observed between the two leaf traits and indices derived from simulated canopy spectra in the NIR and SWIR region (R2 values of 0.87 for LDMC and 0.85 for SLA). Among the tested HYSpex wavelengths, the bands most sensitive to variation were 2298.69 nm for LDMC and 2280.71 nm for SLA. The effects of the stated structural variables on the relationships were best controlled by the modified normalized difference (mND) vegetation index (VI): ([R2275 - R1920]/[R2275 + R1920 - 2 * R1520]). The structural variables that most affected the relationship were forest SD and CD. The modeling results suggest that the spectral variation due to changes in LDMC and SLA is best captured for stands with SD {\textgreater} 400 trees/ha and CD ≥ 5 m. The influence of LAI and SH on the relationships can be greatly reduced using VIs. We conclude that LDMC and SLA can be accurately estimated from canopy reflectance, irrespective of the heterogeneity of structural variables, providing that canopy cover exceeds 50\%.},

Canopy reflectance and the corresponding quantities of LAI, PAI (Plant Area Index), GAI (Green Area Index) and effective GAI (GAIeff) are first calculated using a 3D radiative transfer model (RTM) applied to 3D wheat and maize architecture models. A range of phenological stages, leaf optical properties, soil reflectance, canopy structure and sun directions is considered. Several retrieval methods are compared, including vegetation indices (VIs) combined with a semi-empirical model, and 1D or 3D RTM combined with a machine learning inversion approach. Results show that GAIeff is best estimated from remote sensing observations. The RTM inversion using a 3D model provides more accurate GAIeff estimates compared with VIs and the 1D PROSAIL model with RMSE = 0.33 for wheat and RMSE= 0.43 for maize. GAIeff offers the advantage to be easily accessible from ground measurements at the decametric resolution. It was therefore concluded that the most efficient retrieval approach would be to use machine learning algorithms trained over paired GAIeff and the corresponding canopy reflectance derived either from realistic 3D canopy models or from experimental measurements. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data are used by agricultural agencies for many essential operational crop monitoring programmes. But optical sensors often miss key growth stages due to cloud cover interference, impacting the performance of operational activities. Although the synergistic use of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery can provide time series data, any SAR-optical integration necessitates building a relationship between these two data sources. The objective of this study was to use a semi-empirical Canopy Structure Dynamics Model (CSDM), Growing Degree Days (GDD), and SAR parameters calibrated to optical NDVI to derive daily estimates of canola crop condition over an entire growing season. RADARSAT-2 Fine Quad-pol and RapidEye images were collected over three years for a study site in western Canada. Object-based image analysis was applied to study the relationship between the optical and SAR time series data. Significant correlations were documented between a number of SAR parameters and optical NDVI, specifically a ratio of backscatter intensities (HH-HV)/(HH+HV), a ratio of volume to surface scattering extracted from the Freeman Durden decomposition, and Entropy from the Cloude-Pottier decomposition. Correlations (r-values) between these SAR parameters and optical NDVI ranged from 0.63 to 0.84 for the three years of data. Based on this analysis, a simple statistical model was used to relate SAR parameters to optical NDVI, creating a SAR-calibrated NDVI (SARcal-NDVI). A CSDM was fit to the SARcal-NDVI for each canola field, constructing a temporal vegetation index curve which captured canopy development from emergence to senescence. Coefficients of determination (R2) were 0.87 0.86 and 0.82 for entropy, the volume-surface scattering ratio, and the ratio of backscatter intensities (HH-HV)/(HH+HV), respectively, demonstrating a good model fit. The CSDM describes well the temporal evolution of SARcal-NDVI. Using the CSDM, SARcal-NDVI and GDD, the canola condition can be estimated for any given day in the growing season. In fact when the CSDM was used to estimate SARcal-NDVI for the exact days of RapidEye acquisitions, correlations with optically derived NDVI were high. The strongest correlations with RapidEye NDVI were reported for the volume-surface scattering ratio (R2 of 0.69 and RMSE of 0.15). The SARcal-NDVI estimated from the CSDM was also physically meaningful. Field-based biomass was significantly correlated (R2 of 0.79) with the SARcal-NDVI calculated using the volume-surface scattering ratio. Although further research is needed to extend this method to other crops, these results demonstrate that SAR data can be used to estimate vegetation conditions and when coupled with a CSDM, integrated into current monitoring operations based on optical NDVI. As a next step, the research team will be assessing SARcal-NDVI in a national operational programme which reports on crop yields using modelling with optical-based NDVI.},

Traditional methods for calculating GDD assume linear developmental responses to temperature and cannot precisely account for the delay in growth or development at temperatures above the optimal temperature (Topt). A new nonlinear method for calculating GDD was developed. Variations in the prediction of the dates since sowing to various developmental stages and performance measures for describing the accumulation of dry matter by GDD for two widely planted crops (corn and wheat) were used to evaluate the new method in comparison with the traditional methods. The new method predicted the dates of the developmental stages more precisely (date variations reduced by 1 d), and the errors for the predictions of the accumulation of dry matter for winter wheat and corn were smaller. The method was most promising for spring wheat. The new method was more stable and more precise than traditional methods, especially when Topt was lower than the maximum air temperature.},

	abstract = {Wheat (Triticum aestivum) production in the rainfed area of Pothwar Pakistan is extremely vulnerable to high temperature. The expected increase in temperature due to global warming should result in shorter crop life cycles, and thus lower biomass and grain yield. Two major factors control wheat phenological development: temperature and photoperiod. To evaluate wheat development in response to these factors, we conducted experiments that created diverse temperature and daylength conditions by adjusting the crop sowing time. The study was conducted during 2013–14 and 2014–15 using five spring wheat genotypes, four sowing times, at three sites under rainfed management in Pothwar, Pakistan. Wheat crops experienced more cold days with early sowing, but later sowing dates resulted in higher temperatures, especially from anthesis to maturity. These treatments produced large differences in phenology, biomass production, and yield. To investigate whether growing degree days (GDD) and photoperiod algorithms could predict wheat phenology under these changing conditions, GDD was calculated based on the method proposed by Wang and Engel while photoperiod followed the approach introduced in the APSIM crop growth model. GDD was calculated separately and in combination with photoperiod from germination to anthesis. For the grain filling period, only GDD was calculated. The observed and predicted number of days to anthesis and maturity were in good agreement, showing that the combination of GDD and photoperiod algorithms provided good estimations of spring wheat phenology under variable temperature and daylength conditions.},

	abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) is a key variable for the understanding of several eco-physiological processes within a vegetation canopy. The LAI could thus provide vital information for the management of the environment and agricultural practices when estimated continuously over time and space thanks to remote sensing sensors. This study proposed a method to estimate LAI spatial and temporal variation based on multi-temporal remote sensing observations processed using a simple semi-mechanistic canopy structure dynamic model (CSDM) coupled with a radiative transfer model (RTM). The CSDM described the temporal evolution of the LAI as function of the accumulated daily air temperature as measured from classical ground meteorological stations. The retrieval performances were evaluated for two different data sets: first, a data set simulated by the RTM but taking into account realistic measurement conditions and uncertainties resulting from different error sources; second, an experimental data set acquired over maize crops the Blue Earth City area (USA) in 1998. Results showed that the proposed approach improved significantly the retrieval performances for LAI mainly by smoothing the residual errors associated to each individual observation. In addition it provides a way to describe in a continuous manner the LAI time course from a limited number of observations during the growth cycle.},

	abstract = {Foliage and soil temperatures are key variables for assessing the exchanges of turbulent heat fluxes between vegetated land and the atmosphere. Using multiple-view-angle thermal-infrared (TIR) observations, the temperatures of soil and vegetation may be retrieved. However, particularly for sparsely vegetated areas, the soil and vegetation component temperatures in the sun and in the shade may be very different depending on the solar radiation, the physical properties of the surface, and the meteorological conditions. This may interfere with a correct retrieval of component temperatures, but it might also yield extra information related to canopy structure. Both are strong reasons to investigate this phenomenon in some more detail. To this end, the relationship between the TIR radiance directionality and the component temperatures has been analyzed. In this paper, we extend the four-stream radiative transfer (RT) formalism of the Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves model family to the TIR domain. This new approach enables us to simulate the multiple scattering and emission inside a geometrically homogenous but thermodynamically heterogeneous canopy for optical as well as thermal radiation using the same modeling framework. In this way top-of-canopy thermal radiances observed under multiple viewing angles can be related to the temperatures of sunlit and shaded soil and sunlit and shaded leaves. In this paper, we describe the development of this unified optical-thermal RT theory and demonstrate its capabilities.

Remote sensing data assimilation appears as a good tool to provide more information about canopy state variables in time and space. It permits a reduction in the uncertainties in crop functioning model predictions. This study presents the ﬁrst step of the assimilation of optical remote sensing data into a crop functioning model. It consists in deﬁning a coupling strategy between well known and validated crop functioning and radiative transfer models (RTM), applied to wheat crops. The radiative transfer model is ﬁrst adapted to consistently describe wheat, considering of four layers in the canopy that contain different vegetation organs (soil, yellow leaves and senescent stems, green leaves and stems, green and senescent ears). The coupling is then performed through several state variables: leaf area index, leaf chlorophyll content, organ dry matter and relative water content. The relationships between the CFM outputs (agronomic variables) and RTM inputs (biophysical variables) are deﬁned using experimental data sets corresponding to wheat crops under different climatic and stress conditions. The coupling scheme is then tested on the data set provided by the Alpilles–ReSeDA campaign. Results show a good ﬁtting between the simulated reﬂectance data at top of canopy and the measured ones provided by SPOT images corrected from atmospheric and geometric effects, with a root mean square error lower than 0.05 for all the wavebands. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an important parameter that describes maize growth, vegetation structure, light absorption and subsequently maize biomass and grain yield (GY). The main goal for this study was to estimate maize biomass and GY through LAI retrieved from hyperspectral aerial images using a PROSAIL model inversion and compare its performance with biomass and GY estimations through simple vegetation index approaches. This study was conducted in two separate maize fields of 12 and 20 ha located in north-west Mexico. Both fields were cultivated with the same hybrid. One field was irrigated by a linear pivot and the other by a furrow irrigation system. Ground LAI data were collected at different crop growth stages followed by maize biomass and GY at the harvesting time. Through a weekly/biweekly airborne flight campaign, a total of 19 mosaics were acquired between both fields with a micro-hyperspectral Vis-NIR imaging sensor ranging from 400 to 850 nanometres (nm) at different crop growth stages. The PROSAIL model was calibrated and validated for retrieving maize LAI by simulating maize canopy spectral reflectance based on crop-specific parameters. The model was used to retrieve LAI from both fields and to subsequently estimate maize biomass and GY. Additionally, different vegetation indices were calculated from the aerial images to also estimate maize yield and compare the indices with PROSAIL based estimations. The PROSAIL validation to retrieve LAI from hyperspectral imagery showed a R2 value of 0.5 against ground LAI with RMSE of 0.8 m2/m2. Maize biomass and GY estimation based on NDRE showed the highest accuracies, followed by retrieved LAI, GNDVI and NDVI with R2 value of 0.81, 0.73, 0.73 and 0.65 for biomass, and 0.83, 0.69, 0.73 and 0.62 for GY estimation, respectively. Furthermore, the late vegetative growth stage at V16 was found to be the best stage for maize yield prediction for all studied indices.},

	abstract = {Winter cover crops are an essential part of managing nutrient and sediment losses from agricultural lands. Cover crops lessen sedimentation by reducing erosion, and the accumulation of nitrogen in aboveground biomass results in reduced nutrient runoff. Winter cover crops are planted in the fall and are usually terminated in early spring, making them susceptible to senescence, frost burn, and leaf yellowing due to wintertime conditions. This study sought to determine to what extent remote sensing indices are capable of accurately estimating the percent groundcover and biomass of winter cover crops, and to analyze under what critical ranges these relationships are strong and under which conditions they break down. Cover crop growth on six fields planted to barley, rye, ryegrass, triticale or wheat was measured over the 2012–2013 winter growing season. Data collection included spectral reflectance measurements, aboveground biomass, and percent groundcover. Ten vegetation indices were evaluated using surface reflectance data from a 16-band CROPSCAN sensor. Restricting analysis to sampling dates before the onset of prolonged freezing temperatures and leaf yellowing resulted in increased estimation accuracy. There was a strong relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and percent groundcover (r2=0.93) suggesting that date restrictions effectively eliminate yellowing vegetation from analysis. The triangular vegetation index (TVI) was most accurate in estimating high ranges of biomass (r2=0.86), while NDVI did not experience a clustering of values in the low and medium biomass ranges but saturated in the higher range ({\textgreater}1500kg/ha). The results of this study show that accounting for index saturation, senescence, and frost burn on leaves can greatly increase the accuracy of estimates of percent groundcover and biomass for winter cover crops.},

In this study, Sentinel-2 data was tested for its ability to estimate winter wheat leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC). Artificial neural network (ANN) and look-up table (LUT) (based on PROSAIL simulations) and vegetation index (VI) methods were applied to retrieve biophysical parameters, and compared with the biophysical processor module embedded in the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software. Based on a set of in situ measurements (62 samples) and near-synchronous Sentinel-2 images, the inversion approaches were applied and validated. The results showed that: 1) Sentinel-2 red-edge bands improved the retrievals of chlorophyll / LAI compared to traditional VIs; 2) the red-edge VIs outperformed other approaches; and 3) the SNAP biophysical processor obtained comparable accuracies of LAI and CCC estimation compared to the ANN and LUT approaches, giving R2 values above 0.5 with relatively low RMSE (1.53 m2/m2 for LAI, and 148.58 μg/cm2 for CCC). We recommend VI retrieval approach for small region with ground measurements, whereas where ground data is not available, SNAP is applicable for versatile and rapid winter wheat parameter estimation (though results need to be evaluated alongside the provided quality indicators). Summarizing, the results demonstrate the suitability of Sentinel-2 data, especially its red-edge bands, for crop biophysical variables retrieval. Future studies will need to make comparisons across canopy types to better assess the capability of the SNAP biophysical processor.},

A total of 49 ESUs (Elementary Sampling Unit) of 30 m × 30 m size were established based on variability in composition and age of plantation stands. In-situ LAI was recorded using plant canopy imager during the leaf growing, peak and senescence seasons. The PROSAIL model was calibrated with site-specific biophysical and biochemical parameters before used to the predicted LAI. The plantation LAI was also predicted by an empirical approach using optimally chosen Sentinel-2 vegetation indices. In addition, Sentinel-2 and MODIS LAI products were evaluated with respect to LAI measurements. MLRA-GPR offered best results for predicting LAI of leaf growing (R2 = 0.9, RMSE = 0.14), peak (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 0.21) and senescence (R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.31) seasons while LUT inverted model outperformed VI’s based parametric regression model. Vegetation indices (VIs) derived from 740 nm, 783 nm and 2190 nm band combinations of Sentinel-2 offered the best prediction of LAI.},

	abstract = {Knowledge about the spatial and temporal distribution of exposed soils is necessary for e.g., soil erosion mitigation. Earth Observation (EO) is a valuable data source for detecting exposed soils on a large scale. In the last couple of years, the multitemporal compositing technique has been used for the generation of so-called exposed soil composites that overcome the limitation of temporarily coverage of the soils with vegetation as it is occurring at agricultural sites. The selection of exposed soil pixels from the stack of multispectral images is mainly done using spectral reflectance indices such as NDVI, NBR2 and others calculated on a per-pixel basis. The definition of the thresholds that are applicable to large areas such as regions, countries or continents is still a challenge and requires a reliable and robust sampling data base. In this study, the Soil Composite Mapping Processor (SCMaP) is used to build exposed soil masks containing all pixels in a given time period showing at least once exposed soil. For this purpose, a modified vegetation index (PV) based on the NDVI is used to separate the soils from other land cover (LC) classes by two PV thresholds. The overall goal of this study is to derive and validate exposed soil masks from multi-year Landsat data stacks for Germany from 1984 to 2019. The first focus is set on the impact of a newly developed sampling approach of LC classes such as urban areas, deciduous forests and agricultural fields that are automatically derived from Corine Land Cover (CLC) data. The spectral-temporal behavior of these LC classes in PVmin/max index composites show larger variability of the PV values compared to a manual sampling for selective LC classes such as urban areas. It reveals that the threshold definition method previously developed by Rogge et al. (2018) is not robust enough and the percentile rule used to define the Tmax threshold had to be adapted from 0.995 to 0.900. On the other hand, the sampling data base has proven to be robust across time and region. The second focus of the paper is to validate all generated exposed soil masks covering Germany for seven time periods from 1984 to 2019. A linear correlation analysis was performed comparing the SCMaP data with surveys from the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) and the CLC inventories. The comparison with both datasets showed high regression coefficients (R2 = 0.79 to 0.90) with small regional deviations for areas in the Northern part of Germany. Strong correlation was found for time periods based on a higher number of cloud free Landsat images such as from 2000 to 2009. This demonstrates the high potential of SCMaP’s to generate exposed soil masks based on an automated sampling and a robust threshold derivation. To contribute to soil erosion studies that need information about where and when soils are bare, accurate exposed soil masks in suitable time periods can be of great value.},

	abstract = {High-quality Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data are important for many regional and global ecological and environmental applications. Unfortunately, residual noise in current NDVI time-series products greatly hinders their further applications. Several noise-reduction methods have been proposed during the past two decades, but two important issues remain to be resolved. First, the methods usually perform poorly for cases of continuous missing data in the NDVI time series. Second, they generally assume negatively biased noise in the NDVI time series and thus erroneously raise some local low NDVI values in certain cases (e.g., the harvest period for multi-season crops).We therefore developed a new noise-reduction algorithm called the Spatial-Temporal Savitzky-Golay (STSG) method. The new method assumes discontinuous clouds in space and employs neighboring pixels to assist in the noise reduction of the target pixel in a particular year. The relationship between the NDVI of neighboring pixels and that of the target pixel was obtained from multi-year NDVI time series thanks to the accumulation of NDVI data over many years, which would have been impossible a decade ago. We tested STSG on 16-day composite MODIS NDVI time-series data from 2001 to 2016 in regions of mainland China and 11 phenology camera sites in North American. The results showed that STSG performed significantly better compared with four previous widely used methods (i.e., the Asymmetric Gaussian, Double Logistic, Fourier-based, and Savitzky-Golay filter methods). One obvious advantage was that STSG was able to address the problem of temporally continuous NDVI gaps. STSG effectively increased local low NDVI values and simultaneously avoided overcorrecting low NDVI values during the crop harvest period. In addition, implementing STSG required only raw MODIS NDVI time-series products without any additional burden of data requirements. All of these advantages make STSG a promising noise-reduction method for generating high-quality NDVI time-series data.},

	abstract = {This paper presents MARMIT-2, a radiative transfer model that predicts the spectral reflectance of soils in the solar domain (0.4–2.5 μm) as a function of their surface moisture. This is an improved version of MARMIT (multilayer radiative transfer model of soil reflectance) that represents a wet soil as a dry soil topped with a thin layer of liquid water. The changes brought in this article concern the mixing of the spectral reflectance of the dry and wet soil areas, the transmission of diffuse light in the water layer, and the inclusion of soil particles in the water layer. Wet soil reflectance is now expressed in terms of dry soil reflectance and three free parameters: the thickness of the water layer, the surface fraction of the wet soil, and a new parameter, the volume fraction of soil particles in the water layer. With more accurate physical modeling, MARMIT-2 simulates soil spectral reflectance with better accuracy than MARMIT. In particular, the fit of the soil reflectance spectra is much better for high water contents, both in the visible range (0.4–0.7 μm) and in the water absorption bands around 1.45 μm and 1.95 μm. The average root mean square error between measured and predicted reflectance obtained on a set of 225 soil samples is about 0.8\% with MARMIT-2 versus 1.8\% with MARMIT.},

	abstract = {Ever increasing data volumes of satellite constellations call for multi-sensor analysis ready data (ARD) that relieve users from the burden of all costly preprocessing steps. This paper describes the scientific software FORCE (Framework for Operational Radiometric Correction for Environmental monitoring), an ‘all-in-one’ solution for the mass-processing and analysis of Landsat and Sentinel-2 image archives. FORCE is increasingly used to support a wide range of scientific to operational applications that are in need of both large area, as well as deep and dense temporal information. FORCE is capable of generating Level 2 ARD, and higher-level products. Level 2 processing is comprised of state-of-the-art cloud masking and radiometric correction (including corrections that go beyond ARD specification, e.g., topographic or bidirectional reflectance distribution function correction). It further includes data cubing, i.e., spatial reorganization of the data into a non-overlapping grid system for enhanced efficiency and simplicity of ARD usage. However, the usage barrier of Level 2 ARD is still high due to the considerable data volume and spatial incompleteness of valid observations (e.g., clouds). Thus, the higher-level modules temporally condense multi-temporal ARD into manageable amounts of spatially seamless data. For data mining purposes, per-pixel statistics of clear sky data availability can be generated. FORCE provides functionality for compiling best-available-pixel composites and spectral temporal metrics, which both utilize all available observations within a defined temporal window using selection and statistical aggregation techniques, respectively. These products are immediately fit for common Earth observation analysis workflows, such as machine learning-based image classification, and are thus referred to as highly analysis ready data (hARD). FORCE provides data fusion functionality to improve the spatial resolution of (i) coarse continuous fields like land surface phenology and (ii) Landsat ARD using Sentinel-2 ARD as prediction targets. Quality controlled time series preparation and analysis functionality with a number of aggregation and interpolation techniques, land surface phenology retrieval, and change and trend analyses are provided. Outputs of this module can be directly ingested into a geographic information system (GIS) to fuel research questions without any further processing, i.e., hARD+.

In this study, we used the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to examine a 34-year trend along with the response of vegetation to climate indicators surrounding the world’s largest megacity: the Pearl River Delta (PRD) of China. An overall increasing trend is observed in vegetation productivity metrics over the study period 1982 to 2015. Increase in winter productivity in both natural ecosystems and croplands is more related to increasing temperatures (r = 0.5–0.78), than to changes in rainfall. For growing season productivity, negative correlations with temperature were observed in cropland regions, and some forests in the northern part of PRD region, suggesting high-temperature stress on crop production and forest vegetation. However, increased winter and spring temperatures provide higher opportunities for cropping in winter. During the decade 1995–2004, vegetation productivity metrics showed a reversal in the upward trend. The geographical and biological complexity of the region under significant climatic and development impacts suggests causative factors would be synergistic. These include our observed decrease in sunshine hours, increasing cloud cover associated with atmospheric aerosols from industrial and urban development, direct pollution effects on plant growth, and exceedance of high temperature growth thresholds.},

	abstract = {Das Berner Seeland umfasst die in einem Dreieck zwischen Neuenburger-, Murten- und Bielersee eingebettete Senke am Jurasüdfuss. Noch vor 160 Jahren prägten Überschwemmungen, Armut und Krankheiten (Malaria) das Leben der Bevölkerung.
Die erste Juragewässerkorrektion (1868 - 1897) verbesserte die Situation für die lokale Bevölkerung entscheidend und eine ertragreiche Landwirtschaft wurde ermöglicht. Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts traten erneut Probleme auf, diesmal bedingt durch die Absenkung grosser Flächen wegen Moorsackung und Moorabbau. Weitere Überschwemmungen waren die Folge. Als Konsequenz wurde ab 1963 die Zweite Juragewässerkorrektion umgesetzt, die 1973 ihren Abschluss fand. Der Prozess des Moorabbaus konnte aber nicht gestoppt werden. Verbreitet finden sich heute nur noch geringmächtige Böden und neue Senken, wo sich wiederum Wasser ansammelt. Für eine produktive Landwirtschaft braucht es aber fruchtbare Böden. Die Landwirtschaft steht somit vor der grossen Herausforderung, eine produktive, ertragreiche aber nachhaltige Bewirtschaftung für die Zukunft sicherzustellen.
Im Berner Seeland laufen bereits einige Planungsprojekte im Hinblick auf die Gestaltung der zukünftigen Nutzung. Unsere Studie ist eine Ergänzung dazu. Wir beschäftigten uns mit der Entstehung der Moore im  Berner Seeland sowie deren Abbau und Moorsackung seit den letzten rund 150 Jahren. Ein spezifisches Augenmerk wurde auf Geländeveränderungen seit 1920 bis heute gelegt. Wir gingen der Frage nach, wie gross die Bodenabsenkungen der letzten hundert Jahre waren und welches die räumliche Verteilung in dieser Hinsicht war. Als Folge der  Absenkungen und Verringerung der Bodenfruchtbarkeit werden seit mehreren Jahrzehnten lokal Massnahmen getroffen, die von Tiefpflügen bis zu Auf schüttungen reichen. Zwei derartige Aufschüttungen wurden von uns näher untersucht, um deren Einfluss auf den Boden und den Abbau der organischen Substanz zu erfassen. Da im Gebiet auch grosse Staatswälder vorhanden sind, stellte sich die Frage, inwiefern auch das Baumwachstum beeinflusst wird und welche Auswirkung dies auf den Torfabbau haben könnte. Das Drainagesystem und Binnenkanalnetz im Grossen Moos ist mit einer Länge von 80 Kilometern sehr komplex. Die Reaktion des  Wasserstands in den Kanälen auf Niederschlagsereignisse, die Funktionsweise des Kanalsystems, die Rauheit der Kanäle und die Dynamik des Grundwassers waren von zusätzlichem Interesse.
Bedingt durch die häufigen Richtungsänderungen und das Mäandrieren der Aare entstanden die Moore im Berner Seeland zu ganz unterschiedlichen Zeitpunkten. Wie unsere Datierungen zeigen, befand sich in der Gegend des heutigen Burgermoos/Lüscherzmoos ein grösserer See, der vor etwa 13’000 Jahren zu verlanden begann. Ab 11’000 Jahren vor heute bildete sich dann ein Moor. Im Grossen Moos fanden erste Moorbildungen etwa 10’000 – 11’000 Jahren vor heute statt. Im Bereich der mäandrierenden Aare konnten wir neue Moorbildungen bis etwa 3200 Jahre vor heute zurückverfolgen. Diese Moore wurden später zum Teil wieder überflutet und zugesandet, was dazu geführt hat, dass heute der Profilaufbau des Moorbodens an solchen Standorten sehr variabel ist. Die Aare lagerte einerseits Sedimente ab und andererseits konnten sich in alten Flussläufen und Überschwemmungsgebieten Feuchtstandorte bilden. Wir  konnten hohe Sedimentationsraten bis etwa 5000 Jahre vor heute nachweisen und dann wiederum während den letzten 1500 – 2000 Jahren. 
Die ertragreiche Landwirtschaft führte in den letzten 150 Jahren zu einem starken Moorabbau. Unter landwirtschaftlicher Nutzung werden Kohlenstoffverluste von bis zu 5 t C/(ha a) gemessen. Unter Waldvegetation beträgt dieser Verlust rund die Hälfte. Damit scheint sich die Waldvegetation  positiv auszuwirken, indem sie die Moorzehrung zwar nicht verhindert, aber nachweisbar zu reduzieren vermag. 
Die Prozesse der Moor- bzw. Bodensackung sind bereits seit der  Ersten Juragewässerkorrektion als ein grosses Problem erkannt worden. In  dieser Arbeit gelang es uns, diese Oberflächenveränderung das erste Mal zu quanti fi zieren und auch räumlich zu differenzieren. 1920 wurden durch das Büro für Juragewässerkorrektion im Grossen Moos detaillierte Höhenkotenpläne erstellt. Die etwas mehr als 44’000 mit dem historischen Messtischverfahren erfassten Kartenpunkte wurden manuell digitalisiert. Auf dieser Basis wurde ein Geländemodell erstellt und mit demjenigen vom Jahr 2016 verglichen. In diesen knapp 100 Jahren konnten als Resultat grossflächig Absenkungen von bis zu 2.5 m nachgewiesen werden. Die gemessenen Absenkungen stimmen gut mit den C-Verlusten und berechneten Moorsackungsbeträgen im Landwirtschaftsland und Waldgebiet überein (0.7 – 2.5 m). Räumlich gesehen wurde eine grosse Variabilität aufgedeckt. Die am stärksten betroffenen Zonen liegen südlich von Ins und westlich von Kerzers. 
Mittels multispektraler Satellitendaten ist es heutzutage möglich, die Bepflanzung und das Wachstum der Felder einheitlich, flächendeckend und kontinuierlich zu beobachten. Diese Technologie steckt zwar noch im Entwicklungsstadium, kann aber langfristig Aufschluss darüber geben, ob und wie die Bodendegradation mit der Art der Bewirtschaftung zusammenhängt, um daraus Massnahmen für eine nachhaltige Landwirtschaft abzuleiten. Der NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), der den roten und infraroten Spektralbereich berücksichtigt, gibt Auskunft über die Vegetationszyklen und diese wiederum über die Art und Intensität des Anbaus. Tendenziell korrelieren die als erhöht erkannten Vegetationszyklen mit dem Moorabbau. 
Das ausgeklügelte Kanalsystem im Berner Seeland dient sowohl der Be- wie auch der Entwässerung. Erst damit wurde eine ertragreiche Landwirtschaft überhaupt ermöglicht, wodurch sich das Berner Seeland zur «Gemüsekammer» der Schweiz entwickelte. Niederschlagsereignisse widerspiegeln sich meist direkt in einer Erhöhung des Grundwasserstandes. Von November bis März sind die Wehre in den Binnenkanälen geöffnet, da für die Landwirtschaft kein zusätzlicher Wasserbedarf besteht. Danach  werden die Wehre schrittweise und nach Bedarf geschlossen, um den Grundwasserstand hoch zu halten und Wasser für die Pflanzen konti nuierlich zur Verfügung zu stellen. Die Zeitreihenanalyse der Grund wasserstände und eine detaillierte Analyse des Jahres 2018 haben gezeigt, dass sich der Grundwasserspiegel durch die Binnenkanäle gut steuern lässt. Sobald die Wehre aktiv geschlossen und/oder geöffnet werden, stabilisiert sich der Grundwasserspiegel und es treten wesentlich kleinere Schwankungen auf. Die hydrologische Rauheit der Kanäle ist in Bezug auf Fliessgewässer eher hoch. Dies charakterisiert die Kanäle als träge bis gleichmässig fliessend (Manning-Strickler Koeffizient 0.0265 – 0.0355 s/m1/3). Aufgrund des sehr geringen Gefälles muss das störungsfreie  Fliessen im ganzen  Binnenkanalsystem gesichert werden. Um weiterhin eine ertragreiche Landwirtschaft betreiben zu können, ist der ständige Unterhalt der Kanäle und Stauwehre eine zentrale Voraussetzung.
Eine weitere wichtige Voraussetzung für eine ertragreiche Landwirtschaft sind fruchtbare Böden. Die Untersuchungen an den beiden Standorten mit erfolgter Aufschüttung zeigen, dass die durchgeführten Massnahmen erfolgreich waren: die Vernässungen wurden gestoppt, der Abbau organischer Materie des darunter liegenden Moorbodens reduziert und die Produktivität erhöht. Dieser Erfolg täuscht aber nicht darüber hinweg, dass das Bodenmaterial während des Einbaus stark verdichtet wurde. Dank der guten physikalischen Eigenschaften des eingebrachten Materials konnten aber Folgeschäden verhindert werden. Der Bodenschutz, die Behörden und Landeigentümer stehen damit vor der grossen Herausforderung, solche Massnahmen verstärkt zu koordinieren und nachhaltig einzusetzen. 
Das Grosse Moos weist auch grössere Waldgebiete aus. Die Auswertung von ca. 8000 Jahrringen von 54 beprobten Bäumen zeigt, dass die Waldvegetation primär durch das Niederschlagsregime und den Grundwasserspiegel gesteuert wird. Die Temperatur hingegen übt auf das Jahrringwachstum einen kleineren Einfluss aus. Da Eschen Tiefwurzler sind, können sie auch aus tieferen Schichten (Grund-) Wasser beziehen, während Fichten als Flachwurzler ihren Wasserbedarf aus dem obersten Bodenbereich abdecken müssen. Je nach Dichte der Bestockung und Ausbreitung der Wurzeln kann dies zu einer Absenkung des Grundwasserspiegels führen. Das Resultat ist eine schwache Absenkung des Moorbodens in der Umgebung der Bäume. Die Waldvegetation wirkt sich insgesamt weniger negativ auf die Kohlenstoffbilanz im Boden aus als dies auf Landwirtschaftsflächen der Fall ist. Eigentlich hätte erwartet werden können, dass der Grundwasserspiegel im Wald tiefer läge als an baumlosen Standorten, da die Bäume generell mehr Wasser aus dem Boden ziehen als Feldfrüchte. Diese Vermutung kann mit den gemessenen Werten jedoch nicht bestätigt werden. Der Beschattungseffekt durch den Wald scheint die Transpiration der Baumvegetation auszugleichen, während auf offenen Flächen die Evaporation, durch stärkere Einstrahlung und Windgeschwindigkeit, den Wasserverlust erhöht. Bäume können sich also generell positiv auf die Böden ihrer Standorte auswirken. In diesem Zusammenhang ist allenfalls eine optimierte Kombination von Forst- und Landwirtschaft (Agroforstwirtschaft) zu erwägen, die eine potentielle alternative Landnutzung für besonders gefährdete Gebiete in Bezug auf Moorzehrung darstellt. 
Die Landwirtschaftsregion Berner Seeland wird zukünftig mit grossen Herausforderungen konfrontiert sein, wie einer steigenden Forderung nach mehr Natur und Bodenschutz sowie ökologischer Aufwertung der landwirtschaftlichen Strukturen ohne die agrarische Produktion allzu sehr einzuschränken.},

	abstract = {Spectroradiometric satellite observations of the ocean are commonly referred to as “ocean color” remote sensing. NASA has continuously collected, processed, and distributed ocean color datasets since the launch of the Sea-viewing Wide-ﬁeld-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) in 1997. While numerous ocean color algorithms have been developed in the past two decades that derive geophysical data products from sensor-observed radiometry, few papers have clearly demonstrated how to estimate measurement uncertainty in derived data products. As the uptake of ocean color data products continues to grow with the launch of new and advanced sensors, it is critical that pixel-by-pixel data product uncertainties are estimated during routine data processing. Knowledge of uncertainties can be used when studying long-term climate records, or to assist in the development and performance appraisal of bio-optical algorithms. In this methods paper we provide a comprehensive overview of how to formulate ﬁrst-order ﬁrst-moment (FOFM) calculus for propagating radiometric uncertainties through a selection of bio-optical models. We demonstrate FOFM uncertainty formulations for the following NASA ocean color data products: chlorophyll-a pigment concentration (Chl), the diffuse attenuation coefﬁcient at 490 nm (Kd,490), particulate organic carbon (POC), normalized ﬂuorescent line height (nﬂh), and inherent optical properties (IOPs). Using a quality-controlled in situ hyperspectral remote sensing reﬂectance (Rrs,i) dataset, we show how computationally inexpensive, yet algebraically complex, FOFM calculations may be evaluated for correctness using the more computationally expensive Monte Carlo approach. We compare bio-optical product uncertainties derived using our test Rrs dataset assuming spectrally-ﬂat, uncorrelated relative uncertainties of 1, 5, and 10\%. We also consider spectrally dependent, uncorrelated relative uncertainties in Rrs. The importance of considering spectral covariances in Rrs, where practicable, in the FOFM methodology is highlighted with an example SeaWiFS image. We also present a brief case study of two POC algorithms to illustrate how FOFM formulations may be used to construct measurement uncertainty budgets for ecologically-relevant data products. Such knowledge, even if rudimentary, may provide useful information to end-users when selecting data products or when developing their own algorithms.},

	abstract = {NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time-series have been used for permitting a land surface phenology retrieval but these time series are affected by clouds and aerosols, which add noise to the signal sensor. In this sense, several smoothing functions are used to remove noise introduced by undetected clouds and poor atmospheric conditions, but a comparison between methods is still necessary due to disagreements about its performance in the literature. The application of a smoothing function is a necessarily previous step to describe land surface phenology in different ecosystems. The aims of this research were to evaluate the consistency of different smoothing functions from TIMESAT software and their impacts on phenological attributes of temperate grassland – a complex mosaic of land uses with natural vegetated and agricultural regions using NDVI-MODIS time series. An adaptive Savitzky–Golay (SG) filter, Asymmetric Gaussian (AG) and Double Logistic (DL) functions to fitting NDVI data were used and their performances were assessed using the measures root mean square error (RMSE), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and bias. Besides, differences on the estimation of the start of the growing season (SOS) and the length of the growing season (LOS) were obtained. High and low RMSE over croplands and grassland were observed for the three smoothing functions; in the rest of the region, the SG filter showed more reliable results. Patterns of difference on the estimation of SOS and LOS between SG filter and the other two models were randomly distributed, where differences of 20–50 days were found. This study demonstrated that methods from TIMESAT software are robust and spatially consistent but must be carefully used.},

	abstract = {Because of the limited spatiotemporal resolutions in vegetation index (VI) products, land surface phenology (LSP) results may not well capture ground-based phenological changes. This is likely the result of the mixed pixel effect: (1) a pixel in VI products may contain an unknown composition of vegetation species or land cover types; and (2) these species differ in their sensitivity to climatic variations. The mixed pixel effect has induced inconsistent findings in LSP with in situ observations of spring phenology. To this end, this study has designed a series of simulation experiments to initiate the methodological exploration of how the green-up date (GUD) of a mixed pixel could be altered by the endmember GUDs and different non-GUD variables, including the endmember composition, minimum and maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the length of the growth period. The study has also compared the sensitivity of two generally adopted GUD identification methods, the relative threshold method and the curvature method (also known as the inflection-point method). The simulations with two endmembers show that even if there is no change in the endmember GUDs, the GUD of the mixed pixel could be substantially altered by the changes in non-GUD variables. In addition, the study has also developed a simulation toolkit for the GUD identification with cases of three or more endmembers. The results of the study provide insights into effective strategies for analyzing spring phenology using VI products: the mixed pixel effect can be alleviated by selecting pixels that are relatively stable in the land cover or species composition. This simulation study calls for in situ phenological observations to validate the LSP, such as conducting climate-controlled experiments on few mixed species at a small spatial scale. The paper also argues for the necessity of isolating GUD trends caused by non-phenological changes in the study of spring phenology.},

	abstract = {Policy decisions are often taken at the regional scale, while crop models, supporting these decisions, have been developed for individual locations, expecting location-specific, spatially homogeneous input data. Crop models are able to account for the variation in climatic conditions and management activities and their effects on crop productivity. However, regional applications require consideration of spatial variability in these factors. Several studies have analyzed effects of using spatially aggregated climate data on model outcomes. The effects of spatially aggregated sowing dates on simulations of crop phenological development have not been studied, however. We investigated the impact of spatial aggregation of sowing dates and temperatures on the simulated occurrence of ear emergence and physiological maturity of winter wheat in Germany, using the phenological model of AFRCWHEAT2. We observed time ranges for crop emergence exceeding 90d, whereas for harvesting this was more than 75d. Spatial aggregation to 100km×100km reduced this range to less than 30 and 20d for emergence and harvest, respectively. Differences among selected regions were relatively small, suggesting that non-climatic factors largely determined the spatial variability in sowing dates and consecutive phenological stages. Application of the AFRCWHEAT2 phenology model using location-specific weather data and emergence dates, and an identical crop parameter set across Germany gave similar deviations in all studied regions, suggesting that varietal differences were less important among regions than within regions. Importantly, bias in model outcomes as a result of using aggregated input data was small. Increase in resolution from 100km to 50km resulted in slight improvements in the simulations. We conclude that using spatially aggregated weather data and emergence dates to simulate the length of the growing season for winter wheat in Germany is justified for grid cells with a maximum area of 100km×100km and for the model considered here. As spatial variability of sowing dates within a region or country can be large, it is important to obtain information about the representative sowing date for the region.},

Quantitative spatial information on phenological cycles and their variability is important for agricultural applications, wildfire fuel accumulation, land management, land surface modeling, and climate change studies. Most phenology studies have focused on temperature-driven Northern Hemisphere systems, where phenology shows annually recurring patterns. However, precipitation-driven non-annual phenology of arid and semi-arid systems (i.e., drylands) received much less attention, despite the fact that they cover more than 30\% of the global land surface. Here, we focused on Australia, a continent with one of the most variable rainfall climates in the world and vast areas of dryland systems, where a detailed phenological investigation and a characterization of the relationship between phenology and climate variability are missing. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} To fill this knowledge gap, we developed an algorithm to characterize phenological cycles, and analyzed geographic and climate-driven variability in phenology from 2000 to 2013, which included extreme drought and wet years. We linked derived phenological metrics to rainfall and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). We conducted a continent-wide investigation and a more detailed investigation over the Murray–Darling Basin (MDB), the primary agricultural area and largest river catchment of Australia. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Results showed high inter- and intra-annual variability in phenological cycles across Australia. The peak of phenological cycles occurred not only during the austral summer, but also at any time of the year, and their timing varied by more than a month in the interior of the continent. The magnitude of the phenological cycle peak and the integrated greenness were most significantly correlated with monthly SOI within the preceding 12 months. Correlation patterns occurred primarily over northeastern Australia and within the MDB, predominantly over natural land cover and particularly in floodplain and wetland areas. Integrated greenness of the phenological cycles (surrogate of vegetation productivity) showed positive anomalies of more than 2 standard deviations over most of eastern Australia in 2009–2010, which coincided with the transition from the El Niño-induced decadal droughts to flooding caused by La Niña.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Land surface phenology is a highly sensitive and simple indicator of vegetation dynamics and climate change. However, few studies on spatiotemporal distribution patterns and trends in land surface phenology across different climate and vegetation types in China have been conducted since 2000, a period during which China has experienced remarkably strong El Niño events. In addition, even fewer studies have focused on changes of the end of season (EOS) and length of season (LOS) despite their importance. In this study, we used four methods to reconstruct Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) dataset and chose the best smoothing result to estimate land surface phenology. Then, the phenophase trends were analyzed via the Mann-Kendall method. We aimed to assess whether trends in land surface phenology have continued since 2000 in China at both national and regional levels. We also sought to determine whether trends in land surface phenology in subtropical or high altitude areas are the same as those observed in high latitude areas and whether those trends are uniform among different vegetation types. The result indicated that the start of season (SOS) was progressively delayed with increasing latitude and altitude. In contrast, EOS exhibited an opposite trend in its spatial distribution, and LOS showed clear spatial patterns over this region that decreased from south to north and from east to west at a national scale. The trend of SOS was advanced at a national level, while the trend in Southern China and the Tibetan Plateau was opposite to that in Northern China. The transaction zone of the SOS within Northern China and Southern China occurred approximately between 31.4°N and 35.2°N. The trend in EOS and LOS were delayed and extended, respectively, at both national and regional levels except that of LOS in the Tibetan Plateau, which was shortened by delayed SOS onset more than by delayed EOS onset. The absolute magnitude of SOS was decreased after 2000 compared with previous studies, and the phenophase trends are species specific.},

	abstract = {Currently, quantifying phenology at landscape to regional scales is not feasible with field data or near-surface sensors. Consequently, the spatial and temporal complexity of phenology has been assessed using satellite-based estimates (land surface phenology, LSP). While estimates from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) capture intraannual patterns of phenology, they have relatively low spatial resolution. Estimates from sensors like Landsat capture finer spatial detail but are often limited by Landsat’s temporal resolution. We implemented a spatio-temporal image fusion method on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and used the resulting dense time series of images to estimate intraannual LSP at 30-meter resolution. We utilized Landsat 8 surface reflectance and MODIS NBAR (Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance; MCD43A4) images from 2016 and 2017 in the interior Pacific Northwest of the United States. Images predicted from the GEE image fusion algorithm were evaluated with true Landsat observations and compared with the accuracy achieved by executing the original ESTARFM algorithm. Excluding snow and cloud obscured observations, the algorithm produced approximately 215 observations per 30-meter pixel in 2017. Root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the GEE predicted images ranged from 0.032 to 0.066, and the RMSPE for the original ESTARFM predicted images from the ranged from 0.027 to 0.064. Phenometric estimates were evaluated with near-surface sensors (PhenoCams) in shrubland, conifer, and agricultural sites and field observations of phenology in grassland, open-pine, and mixed-conifer sites. Although phenometric estimates were dissimilar at all PhenoCam sites, the general temporal pattern of the GEE image fusion and PhenoCam time series was often similar. The start of season derived from the GEE image fusion time series had closer correspondence to the PhenoCam-derived start of season at the shrubland site (13 days) than the agriculture and conifer sites. The end of season was closest at one of the conifer sites and the agriculture site (22 and 31 days, respectively). Trends of some of the field-based phenology observations aligned with phenometrics estimated from the image fusion time series. At the grassland and open-pine field sites, the phenometrics from GEE image fusion were associated with phenophase trends of dominant plant functional types. Though characterizing LSP within the interior Pacific Northwest remains a challenge, this study demonstrates that image fusion implemented in GEE can produce a densified time series capable of capturing seasonal trends in NDVI related to vegetation phenology, which can be used to estimate intraannual phenometrics.},

	abstract = {Monitoring land surface phenology (LSP) is important for understanding both the responses and feedbacks of ecosystems to the climate system, and for representing these accurately in terrestrial biosphere models. Moreover, by shedding light on phenological trends at a variety of scales, LSP provides the potential to fill the gap between traditional phenological (field) observations and the large-scale view of global models. In this study, we review and evaluate the variability and evolution of satellite-derived growing season length (GSL) globally and over the past three decades. We used the longest continuous record of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data available to date at global scale to derive LSP metrics consistently over all vegetated land areas and for the period 1982–2012. We tested GSL, start- and end-of-season metrics (SOS and EOS, respectively) for linear trends as well as for significant trend shifts over the study period. We evaluated trends using global environmental stratification information in place of commonly used land cover maps to avoid circular findings. Our results confirmed an average lengthening of the growing season globally during 1982–2012 – averaging 0.22–0.34 days yr−1, but with spatially heterogeneous trends. About 13–19\% of global land areas displayed significant GSL change, and over 30\% of trends occurred in the boreal/alpine biome of the Northern Hemisphere, which showed diverging GSL evolution over the past three decades. Within this biome, the ‘Cold and Mesic’ environmental zone appeared as an LSP change hotspot. We also examined the relative contribution of SOS and EOS to the overall changes, finding that EOS trends were generally stronger and more prevalent than SOS trends. These findings constitute a step towards the identification of large-scale phenological drivers of vegetated land surfaces, necessary for improving phenological representation in terrestrial biosphere models.},

	abstract = {Land surface phenology (LSP), the study of seasonal dynamics of vegetated land surfaces from remote sensing, is a key indicator of global change, that both responds to and influences weather and climate. The effects of climatic changes on LSP depend on the relative importance of climatic constraints in specific regions—which are not well understood at global scale. Understanding the climatic constraints that underlie LSP is crucial for explaining climate change effects on global vegetation phenology. We used a combination of modelled and remotely-sensed vegetation activity records to quantify the interplay of three climatic constraints on land surface phenology (namely minimum temperature, moisture availability, and photoperiod), as well as the dynamic nature of these constraints. Our study examined trends and the relative importance of the three constrains at the start and the end of the growing season over eight global environmental zones, for the past three decades. Our analysis revealed widespread shifts in the relative importance of climatic constraints in the temperate and boreal biomes during the 1982–2011 period. These changes in the relative importance of the three climatic constraints, which ranged up to 8\% since 1982 levels, varied with latitude and between start and end of the growing season. We found a reduced influence of minimum temperature on start and end of season in all environmental zones considered, with a biome-dependent effect on moisture and photoperiod constraints. For the end of season, we report that the influence of moisture has on average increased for both the temperate and boreal biomes over 8.99 million km2. A shifting relative importance of climatic constraints on LSP has implications both for understanding changes and for improving how they may be modelled at large scales.},

One current example, associated with a high potential to contribute to those demands, is the multi-spectral ESA Sentinel-2 (S2) system. The present study focuses on the evaluation of spectral information content needed for crop leaf area index (LAI) mapping in view of the future sensors. Data from a field campaign were used to determine the optimal spectral sampling from available S2 bands applying inversion of a radiative transfer model (PROSAIL) with look-up table (LUT) and artificial neural network (ANN) approaches. Overall LAI estimation performance of the proposed LUT approach (LUTN50) was comparable in terms of retrieval performances with a tested and approved ANN method. Employing seven- and eight-band combinations, the LUTN50 approach obtained LAI RMSE of 0.53 and normalized LAI RMSE of 0.12, which was comparable to the results of the ANN. However, the LUTN50 method showed a higher robustness and insensitivity to different band settings. Most frequently selected wavebands were located in near infrared and red edge spectral regions. In conclusion, our results emphasize the potential benefits of the Sentinel-2 mission for agricultural applications.},

	abstract = {Detecting changes in land use and land cover (LULC) from space has long been the main goal of satellite remote sensing (RS), yet the existing and available algorithms for cloud classiﬁcation are not reliable enough to attain this goal in an automated fashion. Clouds are very strong optical signals that dominate the results of change detection if they are not removed completely from imagery. As various architectures of deep learning (DL) have been proposed and advanced quickly, their potential in perceptual tasks has been widely accepted and successfully applied to many ﬁelds. A comprehensive survey of DL in RS has been reviewed, and the RS community has been suggested to be leading researchers in DL. Based on deep residual learning, semantic image segmentation, and the concept of atrous convolution, we propose a new DL architecture, named CloudNet, with an enhanced capability of feature extraction for classifying cloud and haze from Sentinel-2 imagery, with the intention of supporting automatic change detection in LULC. To ensure the quality of the training dataset, scene classiﬁcation maps of Taiwan processed by Sen2cor were visually examined and edited, resulting in a total of 12,769 sub-images with a standard size of 224 × 224 pixels, cut from the Sen2cor-corrected images and compiled in a trainset. The data augmentation technique enabled CloudNet to have stable cirrus identiﬁcation capability without extensive training data. Compared to the traditional method and other DL methods, CloudNet had higher accuracy in cloud and haze classiﬁcation, as well as better performance in cirrus cloud recognition. CloudNet will be incorporated into the Open Access Satellite Image Service to facilitate change detection by using Sentinel-2 imagery on a regular and automatic basis.},

	abstract = {Agricultural management increasingly uses crop maps based on classification of remotely sensed data. However, classification errors can translate to errors in model outputs, for instance agricultural production monitoring (yield, water demand) or crop acreage calculation. Hence, knowledge on the spatial variability of the classier performance is important information for the user. But this is not provided by traditional assessments of accuracy, which are based on the confusion matrix. In this study, classification uncertainty was analyzed, based on the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm. SVM was applied to multi-spectral time series data of RapidEye from different agricultural landscapes and years. Entropy was calculated as a measure of classification uncertainty, based on the per-object class membership estimations from the SVM algorithm. Permuting all possible combinations of available images allowed investigating the impact of the image acquisition frequency and timing, respectively, on the classification uncertainty. Results show that multi-temporal datasets decrease classification uncertainty for different crops compared to single data sets, but there was no “one-image-combination-fits-all” solution. The number and acquisition timing of the images, for which a decrease in uncertainty could be realized, proved to be specific to a given landscape, and for each crop they differed across different landscapes. For some crops, an increase of uncertainty was observed when increasing the quantity of images, even if classification accuracy was improved. Random forest regression was employed to investigate the impact of different explanatory variables on the observed spatial pattern of classification uncertainty. It was strongly influenced by factors related with the agricultural management and training sample density. Lower uncertainties were revealed for fields close to rivers or irrigation canals. This study demonstrates that classification uncertainty estimates by the SVM algorithm provide a valuable addition to traditional accuracy assessments. This allows analyzing spatial variations of the classifier performance in maps and also differences in classification uncertainty within the growing season and between crop types, respectively.},

	abstract = {A literature review of freshwater model ecosystem studies with herbicides was performed to assess the NOEC[sub]ecosystem for individual compounds, to compare these threshold levels with water quality standards, and to evaluate the ecological consequences of exceeding these standards. Studies were judged appropriate for this purpose if the test systems simulated a realistic freshwater community, if the experimental design was generally sound (ANOVA or regression design, exposure concentrations described), and if published not earlier than 1980. Almost half of the collected papers did not meet these selection criteria. Effects were classified according to their magnitude and duration. The most sensitive endpoints for photosynthesis inhibitors, the most widely studied group of herbicides, were responses related to community metabolism and the structure of phytoplankton, periphyton and macrophytes. These endpoints showed a clear dose-response relationship. The criteria as set by the Uniform Principles appeared to provide sufficient protection for aquatic ecosystems against herbicides. Possible exceptions are the herbicides with an auxin-simulating mode of action, because aquatic macrophytes appeared to be more sensitive to these substances than algae.Functional responses of communities in phytoplankton-dominated ecosystems sometimes recovered rapidly through shifts in algae species composition and adaptation. Indirect effects on the zooplankton in such systems generally occurred at higher concentrations than primary effects. Adequate studies in macrophyte-dominated systems were rare, but in several experiments a pronounced long-term decline of macrophytes was observed at chronic concentrations only slightly above the NOEC[sub]ecosystem. This may result in considerable indirect effects on the macrophyte-associated fauna. The most important modifying factors with respect to types of effect and recovery rates following the application of herbicides to freshwater ecosystems are also discussed.},

They negatively affected the agricultural workers and trigger social conflicts when employed extensively and without safety measures. Further, they also have adverse effects on the neighboring communities. Chiefly, agriculture workers meet with both direct and indirect exposure with these chemicals. Common man comes in contact with these chemicals by skin contacting which is due to leaking and drifting of pesticides during mixing and causing serious threat to human health such as diabetes, reproductive disorders, neurological dysfunction, cancer and respiratory disorders. In this review, we discussed classification, mechanisms, benefits and adverse effects of the pesticides on both human beings and the environment.

However, no alpine-wide assessment on the relationship between land surface phenology (LSP) patterns and its climatic drivers including snow exists. Here, an assessment of the inﬂuence of snow cover variations on vegetation phenology is presented, which is based on a 17-year time-series of MODIS data. From this data snow cover duration (SCD) and phenology metrics based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) have been extracted at 250 m resolution for the entire European Alps. The combined inﬂuence of additional climate drivers on phenology are shown on a regional scale for the Italian province of South Tyrol using reanalyzed climate data. The relationship between vegetation and snow metrics strongly depended on altitude. Temporal trends towards an earlier onset of vegetation growth, increasing monthly mean NDVI in spring and late summer, as well as shorter SCD were observed, but they were mostly non-signiﬁcant and the magnitude of these tendencies differed by altitude. Signiﬁcant negative correlations between monthly mean NDVI and SCD were observed for 15–55\% of all vegetated pixels, especially from December to April and in altitudes from 1000–2000 m. On the regional scale of South Tyrol, the seasonality of NDVI and SCD achieved the highest share of correlating pixels above 1500 m, while at lower elevations mean temperature correlated best. Examining the combined effect of climate variables, for average altitude and exposition, SCD had the highest effect on NDVI, followed by mean temperature and radiation. The presented analysis allows to assess the spatiotemporal patterns of earth-observation based snow and vegetation metrics over the Alps, as well as to understand the relative importance of snow as phenological driver with respect to other climate variables.},

Discrepancies between RTM assumptions and physical reality can cause systematic errors in surface property estimates. We present a sta­ tistical method to quantify these model errors without invoking ground reference data. Our approach exploits scene invariants — properties of the environment which are stable over space or time — to estimate RTM dis­ crepancies. We describe techniques for discovering these features opportunistically in flight data. We then demonstrate data-driven methods that estimate the aggregate errors due to model discrepancies without having to explicitly identify the underlying physical mechanisms. The resulting distributions can improve posterior uncertainty predictions in operational retrievals.},

	abstract = {The timing of leaf emergence in temperate and boreal forests is changing, which has profound implications for a wide array of ecosystem processes and services. Spring phenology models, which have been widely used to predict the timing of leaf emergence, generally assume that a combination of photoperiod and thermal forcing control when leaves emerge. However, the exact nature and magnitude of how photoperiod and temperature individually and jointly control leaf emergence is the subject of ongoing debate. Here we use a continuous development model in combination with time series of land surface phenology measurements from MODIS to quantify the relative importance of photoperiod and thermal forcing in controlling the timing of canopy greenup in eastern temperate and boreal forests of North America. The model accurately predicts biogeographic and interannual variation in the timing of greenup across the study region (median RMSE = 4.6 days, median bias = 0.30 days). Results reveal strong biogeographic variation in the period prior to greenup when temperature and photoperiod influence greenup that covaries with the importance of photoperiod versus thermal controls. Photoperiod control on leaf emergence is dominant in warmer climates, but exerts only modest influence on the timing of leaf emergence in colder climates. Results from models estimated using ground-based observations of cloned lilac are consistent with those from remote sensing, which supports the realism of remote sensing-based models. Overall, results from this study suggest that apparent changes in the sensitivity of trees to temperature are modest and reflect a trade-off between decreased sensitivity to temperature and increased photoperiod control, and identify a transition in the relative importance of temperature versus photoperiod near the 10 °C isotherm in mean annual temperature. This suggests that the timing of leaf emergence will continue to move earlier as the climate warms, and that the magnitude of change will be more pronounced in colder regions with mean annual temperatures below 10 °C.},

	abstract = {Leaf traits at canopy level (hereinafter canopy traits) are conventionally expressed as a product of total canopy leaf area index (LAI) and leaf trait content based on samples collected from the exposed upper canopy. This traditional expression is centered on the theory that absorption of incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) follow a bell-shaped function skewed to the upper canopy. However, the validity of this theory has remained untested for a suite of canopy traits in a temperate forest ecosystem across multiple seasons using multispectral imagery. In this study, we examined the effect of canopy traits expression in modelling canopy traits using Sentinel-2 multispectral data across the growing season in Bavaria Forest National Park (BFNP), Germany. To achieve this, we measured leaf mass per area (LMA), chlorophyll (Cab), nitrogen (N) and carbon content and LAI from the exposed upper and shaded lower canopy respectively over three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). Subsequently, we estimated canopy traits using two expressions, i.e. the traditional expression-based on the product of LAI and leaf traits content of samples collected from the sunlit upper canopy (hereinafter top-of-canopy expression) and the weighted expression established on the proportion between the shaded lower and sunlit upper canopy LAI and their respective leaf traits content. Using a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm, we separately modelled canopy traits estimated from the two expressions using Sentinel-2 spectral bands and vegetation indices. Our results showed that dry matter related canopy traits (LMA, N and carbon) estimated based on the weighted canopy expression yield stronger correlations and higher prediction accuracy (NRMSECV {\textless} 0.19) compared to the top-of-canopy traits expression across all seasons. In contrast, canopy chlorophyll estimated from the top-of-canopy expression demonstrated strong fidelity with Sentinel-2 bands and vegetation indices (RMSE {\textless} 0.48 µg/cm2) compared to weighted canopy chlorophyll (RMSE {\textgreater} 0.48 µg/cm2) across all seasons. We also developed a generalized model that explained 52.57–67.82\% variation in canopy traits across the three seasons. Using the most accurate Random Forest model for each season, we demonstrated the capability of Sentinel-2 data to map seasonal dynamics of canopy traits across the park. Results presented in this study revealed that canopy trait expression can have a profound effect on modelling the accuracy of canopy traits using satellite imagery throughout the growing seasons. These findings have implications on model accuracy when monitoring the dynamics of ecosystem functions, processes and services.},

Direct methods of measuring LAI are labor-intensive. Previous indirect methods can be inaccurate under some sky conditions and fail to distinguish between green and senescent leaves. Most indirect methods are also somewhat invasive, in that the instrument must be placed below the crop canopy. We have modified the inclined-point quadrat method to estimate LAI, by substituting a laser beam for the traditional metal probe. Laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence is used to detect living leaves (or other organs containing chlorophyll), allowing the crop canopy to be scanned from above. Field tests with sudangrass, wheat, and maize found reasonably good correlations (r2 = 0.76 to 0.98) between LAI estimates from our prototype instrument and from direct harvest of leaves. None of the crops tested had significant dead leaf area. This new method can also provide greater detail on the spatial distribution of LAI (e.g., across crop rows) than previous methods. Because of the limited range at which laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence can be detected, this approach probably would not be useful for research on forests or tree crops.},

We characterized the baseline phenology of the vegetation at the global scale from the GEOCLIM climatology of leaf area index (LAI) estimated from 1-km SPOT-VEGETATION time series for 1999–2010. The phenological metrics were calibrated over an ensemble of ground observations of the timing of leaf unfolding and autumnal colouring of leaves. The start and end of season were best identified using respectively 30\% and 40\% threshold of LAI amplitude values. The accuracy of the derived phenological metrics, evaluated using available ground observations for birch forests over Europe (and lilac shrubs over North America), improved as compared to those derived from MODIS-EVI and produced an overall root mean square error of 7days (19days) for the timing of the start of season, 15 for the end of season, and 16 for the length of season. The spatial patterns of the derived LAI phenology agreed well with those from MODIS-EVI and -NDVI, although the timing of the start, end, and length of season differed by about one month at the global scale, with higher uncertainties in areas of limited seasonality of the satellite signal and systematic biases due to the differences in the methodologies and datasets. The baseline LAI phenology was spatially consistent with the global distributions of climatic drivers and biome land cover.},

Here, we conduct an intercomparison analysis using phenological transition dates derived from near-surface PhenoCam imagery and MODIS satellite remote sensing. We used approximately 600 site-years of data, from 128 camera sites covering a wide range of vegetation types and climate zones. During both “greenness rising” and “greenness falling” transition phases, we found generally good agreement between PhenoCam and MODIS transition dates for agricultural, deciduous forest, and grassland sites, provided that the vegetation in the camera field of view was representative of the broader landscape. The correlation between PhenoCam and MODIS transition dates was poor for evergreen forest sites. We discuss potential reasons (including sub-pixel spatial heterogeneity, flexibility of the transition date extraction method, vegetation index sensitivity in evergreen systems, and PhenoCam geolocation uncertainty) for varying agreement between time series of vegetation indices derived from PhenoCam and MODIS imagery. This analysis increases our confidence in the ability of satellite remote sensing to accurately characterize seasonal dynamics in a range of ecosystems, and provides a basis for interpreting those dynamics in the context of tangible phenological changes occurring on the ground.},

This improves the results especially over low background albedos. The error of the method for various ground reflectance spectra is below 7\% for most of the spectra. The channel combinations for two test cases are then defined, using a quantitative procedure, which is based on MODTRAN simulations and the image itself. An error analysis indicates that the influence of aerosols and channel calibration is minimal. The APDA technique is then applied to two AVIRIS images acquired in 1991 and 1995. The accuracy of the measured water vapor columns is within a range of ±5\% compared to ground truth radiosonde data.},

Here, uncertainty estimates are derived using the comparison on a 12th-degree grid of coincident daily records of the remote-sensing reflectance RRS obtained with the same processing chain from three satellite missions, MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS. The approach is spatially resolved and produces σ, the part of the RRS uncertainty budget associated with random effects. The global average of σ decreases with wavelength from approximately 0.7–0.910−3sr−1 at 412nm to 0.05–0.110−3sr−1 at the red band, with uncertainties on σ evaluated as 20–30\% between 412 and 555nm, and 30–40\% at 670nm. The distribution of σ shows a restricted spatial variability and small variations with season, which makes the multi-annual global distribution of σ an estimate applicable to all retrievals of the considered missions. The comparison of σ with other uncertainty estimates derived from field data or with the support of algorithms provides a consistent picture. When translated in relative terms, and assuming a relatively low bias, the distribution of σ suggests that the objective of a 5\% uncertainty is fulfilled between 412 and 490nm for oligotrophic waters (chlorophyll-a concentration below 0.1mgm−3). This study also provides comparison statistics. Spectrally, the mean absolute relative difference between RRS from different missions shows a characteristic U-shape with both ends at blue and red wavelengths inversely related to the amplitude of RRS. On average and for the considered data sets, SeaWiFS RRS tend to be slightly higher than MODIS RRS, which in turn appear higher than MERIS RRS. Biases between mission-specific RRS may exhibit a seasonal dependence, particularly in the subtropical belt.},

	abstract = {Background:  Robust segmentation of canopy cover (CC) from large amounts of images taken under different illumination/light conditions in the field is essential for high throughput field phenotyping (HTFP). We attempted to address this challenge by evaluating different vegetation indices and segmentation methods for analyzing images taken at varying illuminations throughout the early growth phase of wheat in the field. 40,000 images taken on 350 wheat genotypes in two consecutive years were assessed for this purpose.
Results:  We proposed an image analysis pipeline that allowed for image segmentation using automated thresholding and machine learning based classification methods and for global quality control of the resulting CC time series. This pipeline enabled accurate classification of imaging light conditions into two illumination scenarios, i.e. high light-contrast (HLC) and low light-contrast (LLC), in a series of continuously collected images by employing a support vector machine (SVM) model. Accordingly, the scenario-specific pixel-based classification models employing decision tree and SVM algorithms were able to outperform the automated thresholding methods, as well as improved the segmentation accuracy compared to general models that did not discriminate illumination differences.
Conclusions:  The three-band vegetation difference index (NDI3) was enhanced for segmentation by incorporating the HSV-V and the CIE Lab-a color components, i.e. the product images NDI3*V and NDI3*a. Field illumination scenarios can be successfully identified by the proposed image analysis pipeline, and the illumination-specific image segmentation can improve the quantification of CC development. The integrated image analysis pipeline proposed in this study provides great potential for automatically delivering robust data in HTFP.},

	abstract = {Agriculture provides humanity with food, fibers, fuel, and raw materials that are paramount for human livelihood. Today, this role must be satisfied within a context of environmental sustainability and climate change, combined with an unprecedented and still-expanding human population size, while maintaining the viability of agricultural activities to ensure both subsistence and livelihoods. Remote sensing has the capacity to assist the adaptive evolution of agricultural practices in order to face this major challenge, by providing repetitive information on crop status throughout the season at different scales and for different actors. We start this review by making an overview of the current remote sensing techniques relevant for the agricultural context. We present the agronomical variables and plant traits that can be estimated by remote sensing, and we describe the empirical and deterministic approaches to retrieve them. A second part of this review illustrates recent research developments that permit to strengthen applicative capabilities in remote sensing according to specific requirements for different types of stakeholders. Such agricultural applications include crop breeding, agricultural land use monitoring, crop yield forecasting, as well as ecosystem services in relation to soil and water resources or biodiversity loss. Finally, we provide a synthesis of the emerging opportunities that should strengthen the role of remote sensing in providing operational, efficient and long-term services for agricultural applications.},

	abstract = {In this study, the spatial variability of nitrogen (N) balances were determined on heterogeneous arable fields in southern Germany using digital methods (combine yield sensing system, tractor mounted multispectral sensor and satellite data, vegetation indices, and models). The aim of this study is to precisely localize N surplus and nitrogen loss potentials through a high spatial resolution. The spatial variability of plant properties (yield, N uptake) were determined in order to calculate the N balances. The spatial variability of soil properties (soil organic carbon content, soil total nitrogen content, available water capacity) were determined to identify the causes of high or low N surplus on sub fields. N surplus, yield, and N uptake determined using different digital methods showed similar spatial variability. N surplus determined in test plots correlated best with N surplus calculated using tractor mounted multispectral sensor data (up to r = 0.67). Site-specific N balancing identified zones with high N loss potential (N surplus up to over 100 kg ha−1), even if, on average, N inputs and N outputs are almost balanced (N surplus = 0). Soil properties showed considerable spatial variation within the fields. Soil organic carbon and soil total nitrogen content was closely correlated in all fields (up to r = 0.97) and were most closely positively correlated with yield and N uptake (up to r = 0.62) and negatively correlated with N surplus (up to r = − 0.62). The combine yield sensor data showed weaker correlations with soil parameters than tractor mounted multispectral sensor and satellite data. Based on these results, digital technologies are suitable for the calculation of site-specific N surplus. However, their accuracy must be further improved before they can be used to make precise management decisions. Site-specific N balancing using digital methods makes it possible to identify N loss potentials at a sub field scale.},

	abstract = {Improvements in soil water balance modeling can be beneficial for optimizing irrigation management to account for spatial variability in soil properties and evapotranspiration (ET). A remote-sensing-based ET and water balance model was tested for irrigation management in an experiment at two University of Nebraska-Lincoln research sites located near Mead and Brule, Nebraska. Both fields included a center pivot equipped with variable rate irrigation (VRI). The study included maize in 2015 and 2016 and soybean in 2016 at Mead, and maize in 2016 at Brule, for a total of 210 plot-years. Four irrigation treatments were applied at Mead, including: VRI based on a remote sensing model (VRI-RS); VRI based on neutron probe soil water content measurement (VRI-NP); uniform irrigation based on neutron probe measurement; and rainfed. Only the VRI-RS and uniform treatments were applied at Brule. Landsat 7 and 8 imagery were used for model input. In 2015, the remote sensing model included reflectance-based crop coefficients for ET estimation in the water balance. In 2016, a hybrid component of the model was activated, which included energy-balance-modeled ET as an input. Both 2015 and 2016 had above-average precipitation at Mead; subsequently, irrigation amounts were relatively low. Seasonal irrigation was greatest for the VRI-RS treatment in all cases because of drift in the water balance model. This was likely caused by excessive soil evaporation estimates. Irrigation application for the VRI-NP at Mead was about 0 mm, 6 mm, and –12 mm less in separate analyses than for the uniform treatment. Irrigation for the VRI-RS was about 40 mm, 50 mm, and –98 mm greater in separate analyses than the uniform at Mead and about 18 mm greater at Brule. For maize at Mead, treatment effects were primarily limited to hydrologic responses (e.g., ET), with differences in yield generally attributed to random error. Rainfed soybean yields were greater than VRI-RS yields, which may have been related to yield loss from lodging, perhaps due to over-irrigation. Regarding the magnitude of spatial variability in the fields, soil available water capacity generally ranked above ET, precipitation, and yield. Future research should include increased cloud-free imagery frequency, incorporation of soil water content measurements into the model, and improved wet soil evaporation and drainage estimates.},

	abstract = {Earth observation data are increasingly used to provide consistent eco-physiological information over large areas through time. Production efficiency models (PEMs) estimate Gross Primary Production (GPP) as a function of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy, which is derived from Earth observation. GPP can be summed over the growing season and adjusted by a crop-specific harvest index to estimate yield. Although PEMs have many advantages over other crop yield models, they are not widely used, because performance is relatively poor. Here, a new PEM is presented that addresses deficiencies for macro-scale application: Production Efficiency Model Optimized for Crops (PEMOC). It was developed by optimizing functions from the literature with GPP estimated by eddy covariance flux towers in the United States. The model was evaluated using newly developed Earth observation products and county-level yield statistics for major crops. PEMOC generally performed better at the field and county level than another commonly used PEM, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer GPP (MOD17). PEMOC and MOD17 estimates of GPP had an R2 and root mean squared error (RMSE) over the growing season of 0.71–0.89 (9.87–17.47 g CO2 d−1) and 0.59–0.83 (6.86–22.20 g CO2 d−1) with flux tower GPP. PEMOC produced R2s and RMSE of 0.70 (0.52), 0.60 (0.61), and 0.62 (0.59), while MOD17 produced R2s and RMSE of 0.65 (0.57), 0.53 (0.66), and 0.65 (0.57) with corn, soybean, and winter wheat crop yield anomalies. The sample size of rice was small, so yields were compared directly. PEMOC and MOD17 produced R2s and RMSE of 0.53 (3.42 t ha−1) and 0.40 (4.89 t ha−1). The most sizeable model improvements were seen for C3 and C4 crops during emergence/senescence and peak season, respectively. These improvements were attributed to C3 and C4 partitioning, optimized temperature and moisture constraints, and an evapotranspiration-based soil moisture index.},

However, the limited land and water resources, climate change, and an increase in extreme events likely to pose a significant threat for achieving the sustainable agriculture goal. Given these challenges, food security is included in the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Since the advent of Sputnik, followed by the Explorer missions, satellite remote sensing is assisting us in collecting the data at global scales. In this work, we review how satellite remote sensing information is utilized to assess and manage agriculture, an important component of ecohydrology. Overall, three critical aspects of agriculture are considered: (a) crop growth and yield through empirical models, physics-based models, and data assimilation in crop models, (b) applications pertaining to irrigation, which include mapping irrigation areas and quantification of irrigation, and (c) crop losses due to pests, diseases, crop lodging, and weeds. The emphasis is on satellite sensors in optical, thermal, microwave, and fluorescence frequencies. We conclude the review with an outlook of challenges and recommendations. This paper is the first of a two-part review series. The second part reviews the role of satellite remote sensing in water security, wherein we discuss the aspects of water quality and quantity along with extremes (floods and droughts).},

Heterogeneous agricultural mosaics of cropland and grassland commonly result from variable land use practices and ecosystem service demands. Switzerland's agricultural land use is considerably spatially heterogeneous due to strong variability in conditions, especially topography and climate, thus presenting challenges to automated agricultural mapping. Nationwide knowledge of the location of cropland and grassland is necessary for effective conservation and land use planning. We mapped the distribution of cropland and permanent grassland across Switzerland. We used several indices largely derived from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery captured over multiple growing seasons and parcel-based training data derived from landholder reporting. The mapping was conducted within Google Earth Engine using a random forest classifier. The resulting map has high accuracy in lowlands as well as in mountainous areas. The map will act as a base agricultural land cover dataset for researchers and practitioners working in agricultural areas of Switzerland and interested in land cover and landscape structure.

            Technical summary
            This article presents the mandate of UNOOSA and its activities to improve awareness and use of space and space technologies for achieving the SDGs. This article presents examples of UNOOSA work in this respect. One example of this work is the Human Space Technology Initiative (HSTI), which aims to involve more countries in activities related to human space flight. One of the flagship HSTI activities is the KiboCUBE programme, a partnership with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) that offers institutions from developing countries the opportunity to deploy 1U (1 Unit) cube satellites from the Japanese Kibo module of the International Space Station (ISS). Other HSTI activities include the partnership between UNOOSA and the China Manned Space Agency to give countries opportunities to fly experiments onboard China's Space Station, as well as partnerships with private firms such as Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) to fly experiments onboard SNC's DreamChaser® spacecraft. Through its UN-SPIDER programme, UNOOSA helps countries use space technology (in particular satellites) to prevent and manage disasters. Through its Space for Women project, UNOOSA promotes the increased participation of women in space and STEM careers. Through increased international cooperation and partnerships, space can make a difference for achieving all the SDGs.},

Under the space accessibility pillar, UNOOSA intends to enable all communities, particularly in developing countries, to use and benefit from space technologies and applications. Building on previous activities and new partnerships, UNOOSA facilitates and provides (i) access to space education; (ii) access to space data; (iii) access to space technology and research facilities; and finally, for the first time, (iv) direct access to space. At the core of these activities is microgravity research, from on-ground simulation to orbital opportunities, which is one of the main tools of the Human Space Technology Initiative. This shift from on-ground space education, applications, technology and simulation to on-orbit technology is directly linked to a UNISPACE+50 thematic priority on “Global partnerships in space exploration and innovation”. At this stage, three partnership programmes are incorporated in this strategy, with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the China Manned Space Agency, and Sierra Nevada Corporation.

It links the spectral variation of canopy reflectance, which is mainly related to leaf biochemical contents, with its directional variation, which is primarily related to canopy architecture and soil/vegetation contrast. This link is key to simultaneous estimation of canopy biophysical/structural variables for applications in agriculture, plant physiology, or ecology, at different scales.

	abstract = {The fraction of green canopy cover (CC) is an important feature commonly used to characterize crop growth and for calibration of crop and hydrological models. It is well accepted that there is a relation between CC and NDVI through linear or quadratic models, however a straight-forward empirical approach, to derive CC from NDVI observations, is still lacking. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of the NDVI-CC relationships with data collected from 19 different studies (N = 1397). Generic models are proposed here for 13 different agricultural crops, and the associated degree of uncertainty, together with the magnitude of error were quantified for each model (RMSE around 6–18\% of CC). We observed that correlations are adequate for the majority of crops as R2 values were above 75\% for most cases, and coefficient estimates were significant for most of the linear and quadratic models. Extrapolation to conditions different than those found in the studies may require local validation, as obtained regressions are affected by non-sampling errors or sources of systematic error that need further investigation. In a case study with wheat, we tested the use of NDVI as a proxy to estimate CC and to calibrate the AquaCrop model. Simulation outcomes were validated with field data collected from three growing seasons and confirmed that the NDVI-CC relationship was useful for modelling research. We highlight that the overall applicability of these relationships to modelling is promising as the RMSE are in line with acceptable levels published in several sensitivity analyses.},

The goal of this study was to evaluate the suitability of the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (S2 MSI) data for winter wheat LAI and CWC estimation with three different inversion approaches in the main farming region in North China. During the winter wheat key growth stages in 2017, 22 fields, each with five independent samples, the total number of sample plot is 110, were designed for experimental measurements. In this study, the LAI and CWC were retrieved separately using empirical models through different spectral indices, neural network (NN) algorithms, and lookup table (LUT) methods based on the PROSAIL model. The accuracies of the estimated LAI and CWC were assessed through in situ measurements. The results show that the LUT inversion approach was more suitable for LAI and CWC estimation than the spectral index-based empirical model or the NN algorithm. With the LUT approach, LAI was obtained with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.43 m2·m-2 and a relative RMSE (RRMSE) of 11\% using seven S2 MSI bands, and CWC was obtained with an RMSE of 0.41 kg·m-2, and an RRMSE of 32\% using five S2 MSI bands. In all the three methods, S2 MSI was sensitive to LAI variation and able to reach higher accuracies when red edge bands were used. However, CWC inversion was still a challenge using S2 MSI data.},

	abstract = {The leaf area index (LAI) is a key biophysical variable for agroecosystem monitoring, as well as a relevant state variable in crop modelling. For this reason, temporal and spatial determination of LAI are required to improve the understanding of several land surface processes related to vegetation dynamics and crop growth. Despite the large number of retrieved LAI products and the efforts to develop new and updated algorithms for LAI estimation, the available products are not yet capable of capturing site-specific variability, as requested in many agricultural applications. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of non-parametric approaches for multi-temporal LAI retrieval by Sentinel-2 multispectral data, in comparison with a VI-based parametric approach. For this purpose, we built a large database combining a multispectral satellite data set and ground LAI measurements collected over two growing seasons (2018 and 2019), including three crops (i.e., winter wheat, maize, and alfalfa) characterized by different growing cycles and canopy structures, and considering different agronomic conditions (i.e., at three farms in three different sites). The accuracy of parametric and non-parametric methods for LAI estimation was assessed by cross-validation (CV) at both the pixel and field levels over mixed-crop (MC) and crop-specific (CS) data sets. Overall, the non-parametric approach showed a higher accuracy of prediction at pixel level than parametric methods, and it was also observed that Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) did not provide any significant difference (p-value {\textgreater} 0.05) between the predicted values of LAI in the MC and CS data sets, regardless of the crop. Indeed, GPR at the field level showed a cross-validated coefficient of determination (R2CV) higher than 0.80 for all three crops.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of Leaf Area Index (LAI) from space is key to identify crop types and their phenology over large areas, and to characterize spatial variations within growers’ fields. However, for years remote-sensing applica­ tions have been constrained by a trade-off between the spatial and temporal resolutions. This study resolves this limitation. Over the past decade, the number of companies and organizations developing CubeSat constellations has increased. These new satellites make it possible to acquire large image collections at high spatial and tem­ poral resolutions at a relatively low cost. However, the images obtained from CubeSat constellations frequently suffer from inconsistency in the data calibration between the different satellites within the constellation. To overcome these inconsistencies, a new method to fuse a time series of images sourced from two different satellite constellations is proposed, combining the advantages of both (i.e., the temporal, spatial and spectral resolution). This new technique was applied to fuse PlanetScope images with Sentinel-2 images, to create spectrallyconsistent daily images of wheat LAI at a 3 m resolution. The daily 3 m LAI estimations were compared with 57 in-situ wheat LAI measurements taken in Australia and Israel. This approach was demonstrated to successfully estimate Green LAI (LAI before the major on-set of leaf senescence) with an R2 of 0.94 and 86\% relative accuracy (RMSE of 1.37) throughout the growing season without using any ground calibration. However, both the Sentinel-2 based estimates and the fused Green LAI were underestimated at high LAI values (LAI {\textgreater} 3). To account for this, regression models were developed, improving the relative accuracy of the Green LAI estimations by up to a further 47\% (RMSE of 0.35–0.63) in comparison with field measured LAI. The new time series fusion method is an effective tool for continuous daily monitoring of crops at high-resolution over large scales, which opens up a range of new precision agriculture applications. These high spatio-temporal resolution time-series are valuable for monitoring crop growth and health, and can improve the effectiveness of farming practices and enhance yield forecasts at the field and sub-field scales.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing of plant phenology as an indicator of climate change and for mapping land cover has received significant scientific interest in the past two decades. The advancing of spring events, the lengthening of the growing season, the shifting of tree lines, the decreasing sensitivity to warming and the uniformity of spring across elevations are a few of the important indicators of trends in phenology. The Sentinel-2 satellite sensors launched in June 2015 (A) and March 2017 (B), with their high temporal frequency and spatial resolution for improved land mapping missions, have contributed significantly to knowledge on vegetation over the last three years. However, despite the additional red-edge and short wave infra-red (SWIR) bands available on the Sentinel-2 multispectral instruments, with improved vegetation species detection capabilities, there has been very little research on their efficacy to track vegetation cover and its phenology. For example, out of approximately every four papers that analyse normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) or enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from Sentinel-2 imagery, only one mentions either SWIR or the red-edge bands. Despite the short duration that the Sentinel-2 platforms have been operational, they have proved their potential in a wide range of phenological studies of crops, forests, natural grasslands, and other vegetated areas, and in particular through fusion of the data with those from other sensors, e.g., Sentinel-1, Landsat and MODIS. This review paper discusses the current state of vegetation phenology studies based on the first five years of Sentinel-2, their advantages, limitations, and the scope for future developments.},

	abstract = {The radiometric uncertainty of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations and weather-related surface conditions caused by frozen conditions, snow and intercepted rain affect the backscatter (    σ 0    ) observations and limit the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals. This study estimates Sentinel-1’s radiometric uncertainty, identifies the effects of weather-related surface conditions on     σ 0     and investigates their impact on soil moisture retrievals for various conditions regarding soil moisture, surface roughness and incidence angle. Masking rules for the surface conditions that disturb     σ 0     were developed based on meteorological measurements and timeseries of Sentinel-1 observations collected over five forests, five meadows and five cultivated fields in the eastern part of the Netherlands. The Sentinel-1     σ 0     observations appear to be affected by frozen conditions below an air temperature of 1      ∘  C    , snow during Sentinel-1’s morning overpasses on meadows and cultivated fields and interception after more than     1.8        m      m    of rain in the 12 h preceding a Sentinel-1 overpass, whereas dew was not found to be of influence. After the application of these masking rules, the radiometric uncertainty was estimated by the standard deviation of the seasonal anomalies timeseries of the Sentinel-1 forest     σ 0     observations. By spatially averaging the     σ 0     observations, the Sentinel-1 radiometric uncertainty improves from     0.85     dB for a surface area of     0.25        h a     to     0.30     dB for 10     h a     for the VV polarization and from     0.89     dB to     0.36     dB for the VH polarization, following approximately an inverse square root dependency on the surface area over which the     σ 0     observations are averaged. Deviations in     σ 0     were combined with the     σ 0     sensitivity to soil moisture as simulated with the Integral Equation Method (IEM) surface scattering model, which demonstrated that both the disturbing effects by the weather-related surface conditions (if not masked) and radiometric uncertainty have a significant impact on the soil moisture retrievals from Sentinel-1. The soil moisture retrieval uncertainty due to radiometric uncertainty ranges from     0.01        m 3        m  − 3      up to     0.17        m 3        m  − 3      for wet soils and small surface areas. The impacts on soil moisture retrievals are found to be weakly dependent on the surface roughness and the incidence angle, and strongly dependent on the surface area (or the     σ 0     disturbance caused by a weather-related surface condition for a specific land cover type) and the soil moisture itself.},

Contributing factors to the uncertainty in radiance measurements include signal-to-noise ratio, goodness of fit of the calibration data to a quadratic equation, and quality of the experimental conditions (i.e. range and number of radiometric levels used to provide the calibration). These sources, as they are identified, are flagged as contributing to the absolute, relative band-to-band, relative camera-to-camera, or relative pixel-to-pixel radiance uncertainties. This paper summarizes the products and results from the uncertainty analysis of radiometric calibrations for the MISR. It also provides an example of a geophysical product retrieval that makes use of these data.},

	abstract = {Plant trait data have been used in various studies related to ecosystem functioning, community ecology, and assessment of ecosystem services. Evidences are that plant scientists agree on a set of key plant traits, which are relatively easy to measure and have a stable and strong predictive response to ecosystem functions. However, the field measurements of plant trait data are still limited to small area, to a certain moment in time and to certain number of species only. Therefore, remote sensing (RS) offers potential to complement or even replace field measurements of some plant traits. It offers instantaneous spatially contiguous information, covers larger areas and in case of satellite observations profits from their revisit capacity. In this review, we first introduce RS concepts of light–vegetation interactions, RS instruments for vegetation studies, RS methods, and scaling between field and RS observations. Further we discuss in detail current achievements and challenges of optical RS for mapping of key plant traits. We concentrate our discussion on three categorical plant traits (plant growth and life forms, flammability properties and photosynthetic pathways and activity) and on five continuous plant traits (plant height, leaf phenology, leaf mass per area, nitrogen and phosphorous concentration or content). We review existing literature to determine the retrieval accuracy of the continuous plant traits. The relative estimation error using RS ranged between 10\% and 45\% of measured mean value, i.e. around 10\% for plant height of tall canopies, 20\% for plant height of short canopies, 15\% for plant nitrogen, 25\% for plant phosphorus content/concentration, and 45\% for leaf mass per area estimates. The potential of RS to map plant traits is particularly high when traits are related to leaf biochemistry, photosynthetic processes and canopy structure. There are also other plant traits, i.e. leaf chlorophyll content, water content and leaf area index, which can be retrieved from optical RS well and can be of importance for plant scientists. We underline the need that future assessments of ecosystem functioning using RS should require comprehensive and integrated measurements of various plant traits together with leaf and canopy spectral properties. By doing so, the interplay between plant structural, physiological, biochemical, phenological and spectral properties can be better understood.},

	abstract = {Leaf chlorophyll is central to the exchange of carbon, water and energy between the biosphere and the atmosphere, and to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. This paper presents the first spatially-continuous view of terrestrial leaf chlorophyll content (ChlLeaf) at the global scale. Weekly maps of ChlLeaf were produced from ENVISAT MERIS full resolution (300 m) satellite data using a two-stage physically-based radiative transfer modelling approach. Firstly, leaf-level reflectance was derived from top-of-canopy satellite reflectance observations using 4-Scale and SAIL canopy radiative transfer models for woody and non-woody vegetation, respectively. Secondly, the modelled leaf-level reflectance was input into the PROSPECT leaf-level radiative transfer model to derive ChlLeaf. The ChlLeaf retrieval algorithm was validated using measured ChlLeaf data from 248 sample measurements at 28 field locations, and covering six plant functional types (PFTs). Modelled results show strong relationships with field measurements, particularly for deciduous broadleaf forests (R2 = 0.67; RMSE = 9.25 μg cm-2; p {\textless} 0.001), croplands (R2 = 0.41; RMSE = 13.18 μg cm-2; p {\textless} 0.001) and evergreen needleleaf forests (R2 = 0.47; RMSE = 10.63 μg cm-2; p {\textless} 0.001). When the modelled results from all PFTs were considered together, the overall relationship with measured ChlLeaf remained good (R2 = 0.47, RMSE = 10.79 μg cm-2; p {\textless} 0.001). This result is an improvement on the relationship between measured ChlLeaf and a commonly used chlorophyll-sensitive spectral vegetation index; the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI; R2 = 0.27, p {\textless} 0.001). The global maps show large temporal and spatial variability in ChlLeaf, with evergreen broadleaf forests presenting the highest leaf chlorophyll values, with global annual median values of 54.4 μg cm-2. Distinct seasonal ChlLeaf phenologies are also visible, particularly in deciduous plant forms, associated with budburst and crop growth, and leaf senescence. It is anticipated that this global ChlLeaf product will make an important step towards the explicit consideration of leaf-level biochemistry in terrestrial water, energy and carbon cycle modelling.},

	abstract = {Planetscope data are acquired from a constellation of low-cost satellites to provide 3 ​m red, green, blue, and near infrared (NIR) data with near-daily global coverage. Differences in the spectral characteristics of the different Planetscope sensor generations imply that they may not provide consistent reflectance time series needed for certain quantitative analyses. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of the surface reflectance and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) differences between the first two generations of Planetscope sensors, known as Planetscope-0 and Planetscope-1. More than 9100 Planetscope images, acquired with cloud cover {\textless}30\% for different months at 500 locations across Africa were compared. Histograms of the Planetscope image overpass time differences over the 500 locations provide insights into the temporal intervals between successive images. The most frequent image overpass difference was one day for Planetscope-0, the same day for Planetscope-1, and one day considering both sensors. The overpass time difference between images sensed on the same day varied from {\textless}1 ​min to 124 ​min, and 64\% of the Planetscope-0 and Planetscope-1 overpass time differences were sensed {\textgreater}60 ​min apart and 25\% were sensed ≤30 ​min apart. Transformation functions were developed and the coefficients are provided so that the user community can adjust the surface reflectance and NDVI from the Planetscope-0 and Planetscope-1 sensors to each other to provide more consistent 3 ​m time series. This was undertaken by statistical comparison of 9.9 million contemporaneous quality filtered Planetscope-0 and Planetscope-1 observations sensed on the same day within 30 ​min (average 11.8 ​min) and ≤5° solar zenith difference. Two linear regression models, reduced major axis (RMA) and Theil-Sen, were used to provide a general depiction of reflectance and NDVI differences between the two sensor generations, and to develop the transformation functions between them, respectively. The Planetscope-0 blue surface reflectance was on average greater than the Planetscope-1 blue surface reflectance by 20.1\%, whereas the Planetscope-0 red, green and NIR surface reflectance were 4.6\%, 5.1\%, and 12.1\% less than the comparable Planetscope-1 bands respectively. The Planetscope-0 atmospherically corrected NDVI was typically about 3.7\% smaller than the Planetscope-1 atmospherically corrected NDVI. These differences are likely primarily due to the different spectral response functions and bandwidths of the two sensor generations. This is supported by our finding that the surface reflectance from the three Planetscope-0 visible band values were more highly correlated with each other than for the Planetscope-1 visible bands. To demonstrate that the transformations performed correctly, the Planetscope-0 surface reflectance and NDVI data were transformed to Planetscope-1 equivalent values, and vice versa, and the temporal consistency of monthly time series containing observations from both sensors were evaluated using a temporal smoothness index. The results of this adjustment demonstrated that the temporal consistency of monthly time series containing Planetscope-0 and Planetscope-1 observations were improved for all bands and for the NDVI.},

	abstract = {Time series from Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites have great potential for modeling vegetation seasonality. However, irregular time sampling and frequent data loss due to clouds, snow, and short growing seasons, makes this modeling a challenge. We describe a new method for modeling seasonal vegetation index dynamics from satellite time series data. The method is based on box constrained separable least squares fits to logistic model functions combined with seasonal shape priors. To enable robust estimates, we extract a base level (i.e., the minimum dormant season value) from the frequency distribution of clear-sky vegetation index values. A seasonal shape prior is computed from several years of data, and in the final fits local parameters are box constrained. More specifically, if enough data values exist in a certain time period, the corresponding local parameters determining the shape of the model function over this period are relaxed and allowed to vary freely. If there are no observations in a period, the corresponding local parameters are locked to the parameters of the shape prior. The method is flexible enough to model interannual variations, yet robust enough when data are sparse. We test the method with Landsat, Sentinel-2, and MODIS data over a forested site in Sweden, demonstrating the feasibility and potential of the method for operational modeling of growing seasons.},

	abstract = {Monitoring cropland phenology from optical satellite data remains a challenging task due to the influence of clouds and atmospheric artifacts. Therefore, measures need to be taken to overcome these challenges and gain better knowledge of crop dynamics. The arrival of cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) has enabled us to propose a Sentinel-2 (S2) phenology end-to-end processing chain. To achieve this, the following pipeline was implemented: (1) the building of hybrid Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) retrieval models of crop traits optimized with active learning, (2) implementation of these models on GEE (3) generation of spatiotemporally continuous maps and time series of these crop traits with the use of gap-filling through GPR fitting, and finally, (4) calculation of land surface phenology (LSP) metrics such as the start of season (SOS) or end of season (EOS). Overall, from good to high performance was achieved, in particular for the estimation of canopy-level traits such as leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content, with normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) of 9\% and 10\%, respectively. By means of the GPR gap-filling time series of S2, entire tiles were reconstructed, and resulting maps were demonstrated over an agricultural area in Castile and Leon, Spain, where crop calendar data were available to assess the validity of LSP metrics derived from crop traits. In addition, phenology derived from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used as reference. NDVI not only proved to be a robust indicator for the calculation of LSP metrics, but also served to demonstrate the good phenology quality of the quantitative trait products. Thanks to the GEE framework, the proposed workflow can be realized anywhere in the world and for any time window, thus representing a shift in the satellite data processing paradigm. We anticipate that the produced LSP metrics can provide meaningful insights into crop seasonal patterns in a changing environment that demands adaptive agricultural production.},

	abstract = {We develop a Bayesian Land Surface Phenology (LSP) model and examine its performance using Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) observations derived from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset. Building on previous work, we propose a double logistic function that, once couched within a Bayesian model, yields posterior distributions for all LSP parameters. We assess the efficacy of the Normal, Truncated Normal, and Beta likelihoods to deliver robust LSP parameter estimates. Three case studies are presented and used to explore aspects of the proposed model. The first case study, conducted over forested pixels within an HLS tile, explores choice of likelihood and space-time varying HLS data availability for long-term average LSP parameter point and uncertainty estimation. The second case study, conducted over the same pixels using only 2018 data, compares annual LSP parameter estimates from our proposed models with those generated using methods described in Bolton et al. (2020). The third case study, conducted on a small area of interest within the HLS tile on an annual time-step (2014–2019), further examines the impact of sample size and choice of likelihood on annual LSP parameter estimates in addition to assessing potential for the proposed models to inform LSP change detection analysis. Results indicate that while the Truncated Normal and Beta likelihoods are theoretically preferable when the vegetation index is bounded, all three likelihoods performed similarly when the number of index observations is sufficiently large and values are not near the index bounds. The case studies demonstrate how pixel-level LSP parameter posterior distributions can be used to propagate uncertainty through subsequent analysis. As a companion to this article, we provide an open-source R package rsBayes and supplementary data and code used to reproduce the analysis results. The proposed model specification and software implementation delivers computationally efficient, statistically robust, and inferentially rich LSP parameter posterior distributions at the pixel-level across massive raster time series datasets. Modeling functions in the rsBayes package and supplementary code sections are threaded, allowing for the use of multiple processing cores to further speed up model fitting for massive datasets. Using a 64 CPU workstation, the first case study analysis took {\textasciitilde}3 days to run using the Beta likelihood model. However, processing time decreases linearly as the number of CPU cores increases. We expect that run times for this LSP modeling approach will decrease substantially as the power of new computing systems increases over time.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.rse.2006.08.002},
	abstract = {Annual, inter-annual and long-term trends in time series derived from remote sensing can be used to distinguish between natural land cover variability and land cover change. However, the utility of using NDVI-derived phenology to detect change is often limited by poor quality data resulting from atmospheric and other effects. Here, we present a curve fitting methodology useful for time series of remotely sensed data that is minimally affected by atmospheric and sensor effects and requires neither spatial nor temporal averaging. A two-step technique is employed: first, a harmonic approach models the average annual phenology; second, a spline-based approach models inter-annual phenology. The principal attributes of the time series (e.g., amplitude, timing of onset of greenness, intrinsic smoothness or roughness) are captured while the effects of data drop-outs and gaps are minimized. A recursive, least squares approach captures the upper envelope of NDVI values by upweighting data values above an average annual curve. We test this methodology on several land cover types in the western U.S., and find that onset of greenness in an average year varied by less than 8 days within land cover types, indicating that the curve fit is consistent within similar systems. Between 1990 and 2002, temporal variability in onset of greenness was between 17 and 35 days depending on the land cover type, indicating that the inter-annual curve fit captures substantial inter-annual variability. Employing this curve fitting procedure enhances our ability to measure inter-annual phenology and could lead to better understanding of local and regional land cover trends.},

Often, these time series have to be filtered before application. The smoothing removes noise introduced by undetected clouds and poor atmospheric conditions. Ground reference measurements are usually difficult to obtain due to the medium/coarse resolution of the imagery. Hence, new filter algorithms are typically only (visually) assessed against the existing smoother. The present work aims to propose a range of quality indicators that could be useful to qualify filter performance in the absence of ground-based reference measurements. The indicators comprise (i) plausibility checks, (ii) distance metrics and (iii) geostatistical measures derived from variogram analysis. The quality measures can be readily derived from any imagery. For illustration, a large SPOT VGT dataset (1999–2008) covering South America at 1 km spatial resolution was filtered using the Whittaker smoother.},

	abstract = {Many biological processes produce only one quantitative outcome per year, resulting from temperatures and precipitation during hundreds of days leading up to the event. Traditional regression approaches incur problems in such a setting, because independent variables are highly autocorrelated and their number often greatly exceeds the number of observations. Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS), a statistical analysis tool developed to handle these situations and widely used in hyperspectral remote sensing, was tested for its usefulness for explaining the climate responses of biological processes, using walnut phenology in California as an example. Observations of first female bloom, first male bloom and leaf emergence of three walnut cultivars at Davis, CA were coupled with daily temperature data since 1951. The dataset was analyzed by PLS, using three temperature inputs: (1) daily mean temperatures, (2) 11-day running means of daily mean temperatures and (3) monthly mean temperatures. For all data constellations, the Variable-Importance-in-the-Projection (VIP) statistic indicated a number of periods, during which temperatures were important determinants of phenological events, and the model-coefficients-of-the-centered-and-scaled-data (MC) statistic showed the direction, in which high temperatures during these phases influenced walnut flowering and leaf emergence. In all analyses, a delaying effect of warm winters, and an advancing effect of warm springs were clearly visible. It was also possible to identify the transition between the chilling and forcing phases, and the VIP and MC plots indicated quantitative differences in the effectiveness of winter chill during different phases of the dormancy season. Such effects have not been captured in any phenology models currently applied to fruit trees, indicating that PLS has potential to help refine such models. PLS can also be used for guiding experimental research by pinpointing the parts of the season that are most important for the timing of budburst. Results suggested that more than 20 years of observed data were necessary for producing clearly recognizable temperature response patterns, limiting the applicability of PLS to long time series.},

Traditional plant phenology provides very accurate information on individual plant species, but with limited spatial coverage. Satellite phenology allows monitoring of terrestrial vegetation on a global scale and provides an integrative view at the landscape level. Linking the strengths of both methodologies has high potential value for climate impact studies. We compared a multispecies index from ground-observed spring phases with two types (maximum slope and threshold approach) of satellite-derived start-of-season (SOS) metrics. We focus on Switzerland from 1982 to 2001 and show that temporal and spatial variability of the multispecies index correspond well with the satellite-derived metrics. All phenological metrics correlate with temperature anomalies as expected. The slope approach proved to deviate strongly from the temporal development of the ground observations as well as from the threshold-defined SOS satellite measure. The slope spring indicator is considered to indicate a different stage in vegetation development and is therefore less suited as a SOS parameter for comparative studies in relation to ground-observed phenology. Satellite-derived metrics are, however, very susceptible to snow cover, and it is suggested that this snow cover should be better accounted for by the use of newer satellite sensors.},

	abstract = {Plant phenology research has gained increasing attention because of the sensitivity of phenology to climate change and its consequences for ecosystem function. Recent technological development has made it possible to gather invaluable data at a variety of spatial and ecological scales. Despite our ability to observe phenological change at multiple scales, the mechanistic basis of phenology is still not well understood. Integration of multiple disciplines, including ecology, evolutionary biology, climate science, and remote sensing, with long-term monitoring data across multiple spatial scales is needed to advance understanding of phenology. We review the mechanisms and major drivers of plant phenology, including temperature, photoperiod, and winter chilling, as well as other factors such as competition, resource limitation, and genetics. Shifts in plant phenology have significant consequences on ecosystem productivity, carbon cycling, competition, food webs, and other ecosystem functions and services. We summarize recent advances in observation techniques across multiple spatial scales, including digital repeat photography, other complementary optical measurements, and solar-induced fluorescence, to assess our capability to address the importance of these scale-dependent drivers. Then, we review phenology models as an important component of earth system modeling. We find that the lack of species-level knowledge and observation data leads to difficulties in the development of vegetation phenology models at ecosystem or community scales. Finally, we recommend further research to advance understanding of the mechanisms governing phenology and the standardization of phenology observation methods across networks. With the opportunity for “big data” collection for plant phenology, we envision a breakthrough in process-based phenology modeling.},

By increasing the inherent resolution of signal extraction procedures while minimizing the effects of cloud cover and prolonged data gaps, such tools can significantly improve land cover classification and land cover change monitoring on multiple scales. This report describes an intuitive approach for tracking the intra-annual details and interannual variability of multiyear time series, employing a sequence of annual high-order polynomial splines (up to the 14th order), stabilized by minimizing model roughness and weighted to fit the upper data envelope to minimize cloud cover bias. The algorithm is tested using multi-year time series for three very different classes of vegetation-stable agriculture, high elevation montane shrubland, and semi-arid grassland with high interannual variability. The results accurately track both short- and long-term land surface phenology and illustrate a robust potential for extracting temporal and spatial detail from a variety of satellite-based multiyear vegetation signals.},

	abstract = {The seasonal cycle of plant community photosynthesis is one of the most important biotic oscillations to mankind. This study built upon previous efforts to develop a comprehensive framework to studying this cycle systematically with eddy covariance flux measurements. We proposed a new function to represent the cycle and generalized a set of phenological indices to quantify its dynamic characteristics. We suggest that the seasonal variation of plant community photosynthesis generally consists of five distinctive phases in sequence each of which results from the interaction between the inherent biological and ecological processes and the progression of climatic conditions and reflects the unique functioning of plant community at different stages of the growing season. We applied the improved methodology to seven vegetation sites ranging from evergreen and deciduous forests to crop to grasslands and covering both cool-season (vegetation active during cool months, e.g. Mediterranean climate grasslands) and warm-season (vegetation active during warm months, e.g. temperate and boreal forests) vegetation types. Our application revealed interesting phenomena that had not been reported before and pointed to new research directions. We found that for the warm-season vegetation type, the recovery of plant community photosynthesis at the beginning of the growing season was faster than the senescence at the end of the growing season while for the cool-season vegetation type, the opposite was true. Furthermore, for the warm-season vegetation type, the recovery was closely correlated with the senescence such that a faster photosynthetic recovery implied a speedier photosynthetic senescence and vice versa. There was evidence that a similar close correlation could also exist for the cool-season vegetation type, and furthermore, the recovery-senescence relationship may be invariant between the warm-season and cool-season vegetation types up to an offset in the intercept. We also found that while the growing season length affected how much carbon dioxide could be potentially assimilated by a plant community over the course of a growing season, other factors that affect canopy photosynthetic capacity (e.g. nutrients, water) could be more important at this time scale. These results and insights demonstrate that the proposed method of analysis and system of terminology can serve as a foundation for studying the dynamics of plant community photosynthesis and such studies can be fruitful.},

	abstract = {High temporal resolution measurements of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) and the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) encode vegetation functioning. However, these signals are modulated by time-dependent processes. We tested the applicability of the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for disentangling fast components (physiology-driven) and slow components (controlled by structural and biochemical properties) from PRI, far-red F (F760), and far-red apparent fluorescence yield (Fy∗760). The proof of concept was developed on spectral and flux time series simulated with the Soil Canopy Observation of Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model. This allowed the evaluation of SSA decomposition against variables that are independent of physiology or are modified by it. Slow SSA-decomposed components of PRI and Fy∗760 showed high correlations with the reference variables (R2 = 0.97 and 0.96, respectively). Fast SSA-decomposed components of PRI and Fy∗760 were better related to the physiological reference variables than the original signals during periods when leaf area index (LAI) was above 1 m2 m−2. The method was also successfully applied to predict light-use efficiency (LUE) from the fast SSA-decomposed components of PRI (R2 = 0.70) and Fy∗760 (R2 = 0.68) when discarding data modeled with LAI {\textless} 1 m2 m−2 and short-wave radiation Rin {\textless} 250 W m−2. The method was then tested on data acquired in a Mediterranean grassland. In this case, the fast SSA-decomposed component of apparent LUE∗ showed a stronger correlation with the fast SSA-decomposed component of Fy∗760 (R2 = 0.42) than with original Fy∗760 (R2 = 0.01).

	abstract = {Satellite remote sensing of vegetation at regional to global scales is undertaken at considerable variations in solar zenith angle (SZA) across space and time, yet the extent to which these SZA variations matter for the retrieval of phenology remains largely unknown. Here we examined the effect of seasonal and spatial variations in SZA on retrieving vegetation phenology from time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) across a study area in southeastern Australia encompassing forest, woodland, and grassland sites. The vegetation indices (VI) data span two years and are from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), which is onboard the Japanese Himawari-8 geostationary satellite. The semi-empirical RossThick-LiSparse-Reciprocal (RTLSR) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model was inverted for each spectral band on a daily basis using 10-minute reflectances acquired by H-8 AHI at different sun-view geometries for each site. The inverted RTLSR model was then used to forward calculate surface reflectance at three constant SZAs (20°, 40°, 60°) and one seasonally varying SZA (local solar noon), all normalised to nadir view. Time series of NDVI and EVI adjusted to different SZAs at nadir view were then computed, from which phenological metrics such as start and end of growing season were retrieved. Results showed that NDVI sensitivity to SZA was on average nearly five times greater than EVI sensitivity. VI sensitivity to SZA also varied among sites (biome types) and phenological stages, with NDVI sensitivity being higher during the minimum greenness period than during the peak greenness period. Seasonal SZA variations altered the temporal profiles of both NDVI and EVI, with more pronounced differences in magnitude among NDVI time series normalised to different SZAs. When using VI time series that allowed SZA to vary at local solar noon, the uncertainties in estimating start, peak, end, and length of growing season introduced by local solar noon varying SZA VI time series, were 7.5, 3.7, 6.5, and 11.3 days for NDVI, and 10.4, 11.9, 6.5, and 8.4 days for EVI respectively, compared to VI time series normalised to a constant SZA. Furthermore, the stronger SZA dependency of NDVI compared with EVI, resulted in up to two times higher uncertainty in estimating annual integrated VI, a commonly used remote-sensing proxy for vegetation productivity. Since commonly used satellite products are not generally normalised to a constant sun-angle across space and time, future studies to assess the sun-angle effects on satellite applications in agriculture, ecology, environment, and carbon science are urgently needed. Measurements taken by new-generation geostationary (GEO) satellites offer an important opportunity to refine this assessment at finer temporal scales. In addition, studies are needed to evaluate the suitability of different BRDF models for normalising sun-angle across a broad spectrum of vegetation structure, phenological stages and geographic locations. Only through continuous investigations on how sun-angle variations affect spatiotemporal vegetation dynamics and what is the best strategy to deal with it, can we achieve a more quantitative remote sensing of true signals of vegetation change across the entire globe and through time.},

	abstract = {With an upcoming unprecedented stream of imaging spectroscopy data, there is a rising need for tools and software applications exploiting the spectral possibilities to extract relevant information on an operational basis. In this study, we investigate the potential of a scientific processor designed to quantify biophysical and biochemical crop traits from spectroscopic imagery of the upcoming Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite. Said processor relies on a hybrid retrieval workflow executing pre-trained machine learning regression models fast and efficiently based on training data from a lookup table of synthetic vegetation spectra and their associated parameterization of the well-known radiative transfer model (RTM) PROSAIL. The established models provide spatial information about leaf area index (LAI), average leaf inclination angle (ALIA), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab) and leaf mass per area (Cm). In contrast to using site-specific training data, the approach facilitates a universal application without the need to integrate a priori information into the processor. Four machine learning algorithms, namely artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine regression (SVR), and Gaussian process regression (GPR), were found to estimate bio­ physical and biochemical variables of unseen targets with high performance (relative error scores {\textless} 10\%). ANNs excelled in terms of accuracy, model size and execution time when the 242 spectral bands were transformed into 15 principal components, the signals of which were scaled by a z-transformation. Validation using in situ data from the SPARC03 Barrax campaign dataset revealed an overall good estimation of measured functional traits, for instance for LAI with root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.81 m2 m− 2, and for Cab RMSE of 6.2 µg cm− 2 with the ANN model. Moreover, both crop traits could be successfully mapped using a pseudo-EnMAP scene revealing plausible within-field patterns. Conformity with LAI output of the SNAP biophysical processor was found especially for grassland and maize in the vegetative stages. Based on these findings, ANN models are considered the best choice for implementation of a hybrid retrieval workflow within the context of operational agricultural crop traits monitoring from future satellite imaging spectroscopy.},

The aim of this study is to analyze the sensitivity of remote sensing features to phenological development of winter wheat and winter barley and to test their transferability in two test sites in Northeast Germany and in two years. Local minima, local maxima and breakpoints of smoothed time series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of the Sentinel-1 VH (vertical-horizontal) and VV (vertical-vertical) intensities and their ratio VH/VV; of the polarimetric features entropy, anisotropy and alpha derived from polarimetric decomposition; as well as of the vegetation index NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) calculated using optical data of Sentinel-2 are compared with entry dates of phenological stages. The beginning of stem elongation produces a breakpoint in the time series of most parameters for wheat and barley. Furthermore, the beginning of heading could be detected by all parameters, whereas particularly a local minimum of VH and VV backscatter is observed less then 5 days before the entry date. The medium milk stage can not be detected reliably, whereas the hard dough stage of barley takes place approximately 6–8 days around a local maximum of VH backscatter in 2018. Harvest is detected for barley using the fourth breakpoint of most parameters. The study shows that backscatter and polarimetric parameters as well as the NDVI are sensitive to specific phenological developments. The transferability of the approach is demonstrated, whereas differences between test sites and years are mainly caused by meteorological differences.},

	abstract = {Many approaches have been proposed over the last two decades for managing the spatial variation of soil and crops. In this chapter we discuss the importance of quantifying and managing spatial variation in crop production fields to implement site-specific crop management. We outline the challenges that soil and crop scientists have addressed since the inception of precision agriculture (PA) in terms of managing soil spatial variation, and the development of simple, stable and inexpensive techniques for quantifying and managing it with tools such as site-specific management zones. This chapter summarizes and cites the work of several scientists who have worked in the area of development and evaluation of site-specific management zones from around the world. Geostatistics is being applied increasingly in PA because of the need for accurate maps on which to base site-specific management. For soil and crop properties that require costly sampling and analysis, there are often insufficient data for geostatistical analyses and this chapter shows how management zones can provide an interim solution to more comprehensive site-specific management. Physical and chemical soil properties have been the most widely used properties for delineating management zones, however, intensive data from remote and proximal sensors are being used increasingly. The case study describes methods of delineating and evaluating management zones.},

	abstract = {Plant functional traits are the features (morphological, physiological, phenological) that represent ecological strategies and determine how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels and inﬂuence ecosystem properties. Variation in plant functional traits, and trait syndromes, has proven useful for tackling many important ecological questions at a range of scales, giving rise to a demand for standardised ways to measure ecologically meaningful plant traits. This line of research has been among the most fruitful avenues for understanding ecological and evolutionary patterns and processes. It also has the potential both to build a predictive set of local, regional and global relationships between plants and environment and to quantify a wide range of natural and human-driven processes, including changes in biodiversity, the impacts of species invasions, alterations in biogeochemical processes and vegetation–atmosphere interactions. The importance of these topics dictates the urgent need for more and better data, and increases the value of standardised protocols for quantifying trait variation of different species, in particular for traits with power to predict plant- and ecosystemlevel processes, and for traits that can be measured relatively easily. Updated and expanded from the widely used previous version, this handbook retains the focus on clearly presented, widely applicable, step-by-step recipes, with a minimum of text on theory, and not only includes updated methods for the traits previously covered, but also introduces many new protocols for further traits. This new handbook has a better balance between whole-plant traits, leaf traits, root and stem traits and regenerative traits, and puts particular emphasis on traits important for predicting species’ effects on key ecosystem properties. We hope this new handbook becomes a standard companion in local and global efforts to learn about the responses and impacts of different plant species with respect to environmental changes in the present, past and future.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing technology allows monitoring the progress of vegetation and crop phenology in large regions. Seasonal vegetation trends are commonly estimated from high temporal resolution but coarse spatial resolution satellite imagery, e.g., from MODIS-NDVI (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer—Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time-series, which has usually limited their application to scenarios with few land uses or crops covering areas larger than actual parcel sizes. As an alternative, this paper proposes a general and robust procedure to map crop phenology at the level of individual crop parcels, and validates its feasibility in a complex and diverse cropland area located in central California. A first calibration phase consisted of evaluating the three curve-fitting models implemented in the TIMESAT software (i.e., asymmetric Gaussian (AG), double logistic (DL), and adaptive Savitzky–Golay (SG) filtering) and reporting the model and its settings that best adjusted to the MODIS-NDVI profile of each crop studied. Next, based on the selected crop-specific models and with a crop map previously obtained from ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) multi-temporal images, the procedure mapped four crop calendar events (i.e., start, end, middle, and length of the season) and five phenology-related metrics (i.e., base, maximum, amplitude, derivatives, and integrals of the NDVI values) of the study region by object-based image analysis (OBIA) of the MODIS-NDVI time-series. To mitigate the impact of mixed pixels, the OBIA procedure was designed to automatically apply a restrictive criterion based on the coverage of MODIS-NDVI pixels in each crop parcel: (1) using only the MODIS-NDVI pixels that were placed 100\% within each crop parcel (i.e., “pure” pixels); or (2) if no “pure” pixels exist in any crop parcel, using only pixels with coverage percentages greater than 50\%, and in such cases, reporting the mixing percentage in the output file. The calibration phase showed that the performance of the SG filtering was superior in most crops, with the exception of rice, while the AG model was intermediate in all of the cases. Differences between the dates of the start and end of the season that were observed in 120 ground-truth fields and the ones estimated by the crop-specific models were in a range of 11 days (for the corn fields) and 22 days (for the vineyard fields) on average. The OBIA procedure was also validated in 240 independent parcels with “pure” MODIS-NDVI pixels, reporting 89\% and 82\% of accuracy when mapping the start and end of the season, respectively. Our results revealed different growth patterns of the studied crops, especially of the crop calendar events of herbaceous (i.e., corn, rice, sunflower, and tomato) and woody crops (i.e., almond, walnut, and vineyard), of the NDVI derivatives of rice and the other studied herbaceous crops, and of the NDVI integrals of vineyard and the other studied woody crops. The resulting maps and tables provide valuable geospatial information for every parcel over time with several applications in cropland management, irrigation scheduling, and ecosystem modeling.},

TIMESAT is a free software package for processing satellite time-series data in order to investigate problems related to global change and monitoring of vegetation resources. The assumptions behind TIMESAT are that the sensor data represent the seasonal vegetation signal in a meaningful way, and that the underlying vegetation variation is smooth. A number of processing steps are taken to transform the noisy signals into smooth seasonal curves, including fitting asymmetric Gaussian or double logistic functions, or smoothing the data using a modified Savitzky-Golay filter. TIMESAT can adapt to the upper envelope of the data, accounting for negatively biased noise, and can take missing data and quality flags into account. The software enables the extraction of seasonality parameters, like the beginning and end of the growing season, its length, integrated values, etc. TIMESAT has been used in a large number of applied studies for phenology parameter extraction, data smoothing, and general data quality improvement. To enable efficient analysis of future Earth Observation data sets, developments of TIMESAT are directed towards processing of high-spatial resolution data from e.g. Landsat and Sentinel-2, and use of spatio-temporal data processing methods.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of gross primary production (GPP), the amount of carbon absorbed by plants via photo­ synthesis, is of great importance for understanding ecosystem functions, carbon cycling, and climate-carbon feedbacks. Remote sensing has been widely used to quantify GPP at regional to global scales. However, polarorbiting satellites (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel, Terra, Aqua, Suomi NPP, JPSS, OCO-2) lack the capability to examine the diurnal cycles of GPP because they observe the Earth’s surface at the same time of day. The Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS), launched in June 2018, observes the land surface temperature (LST) at different times of day with high spatial resolution (70 m × 70 m) from the International Space Station (ISS). Here, we made use of ECOSTRESS data to predict instantaneous GPP with high spatial resolution for different times of day using a data-driven approach based on machine learning. The predictive GPP model used instantaneous ECOSTRESS LST observations along with the daily enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), land cover type from the National Land Cover Database (NCLD), and instantaneous meteorological data from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. Our model estimated instantaneous GPP across 56 flux tower sites fairly well (R2 = 0.88, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 2.42 μmol CO2 m− 2 s− 1). The instantaneous GPP estimates driven by ECOSTRESS LST captured the diurnal variations of tower GPP for different biomes. We then produced multiple high resolution ECOSTRESS GPP maps for the central and northern California. We found distinct changes in GPP at different times of day (e.g., higher in late morning, peak around noon, approaching zero at dusk), and clear differences in productivity across landscapes (e.g., savannas, croplands, grasslands, and forests) for different times of day. ECOSTRESS GPP also captured the seasonal variations in the diurnal cycling of photosynthesis. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using ECOSTRESS data for producing instantaneous GPP (i.e., GPP for the acquisition time of the ECOSTRESS data) for different times of day. The ECOSTRESS GPP can shed light on how plant photosynthesis and water use vary over the course of the diurnal cycle and inform agricultural management and future improvement of terrestrial biosphere/land surface models.},

	abstract = {This study presents first results on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) sensor onboard the geostationary satellite Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) covering the African continent. With a temporal resolution of 15 min MSG offers complementary information for NDVI monitoring compared to vegetation monitoring based on polar orbiting satellites. The improved temporal resolution has potential implications for accurate NDVI assessment of the African continent; e.g. the increased amount of available scenes are expected to help overcome problems related to cloud cover which makes the MSG data particularly well suited for early warning systems. Time series of 2004 MSG NDVI was compared to MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Terra and Aqua NDVI for the Dahra site in the Senegalese Sahel, West Africa. It was found that NDVI was available for 82 days with multiple cloud free acquisitions per day during the growing season as compared to 47 days with information from either MODIS Terra or Aqua for that particular site. Differences in MSG SEVIRI and MODIS BRDF on a seasonal scale were found to influence the time series of NDVI for the test site; MSG NDVI being higher than MODIS in July–August and lower in October–November. Preliminary composite analysis suggests that the period of compositing to produce continent scale cloud free products can be reduced to ∼5 days using MSG NDVI as compared to polar orbiting data. With the availability of diurnal reflectance information the significance of differences between the red and near-infrared wavelengths due to anisotropy become evident, causing diurnal variations in observed NDVI. Diurnal MSG NDVI was compared to in situ measured MSG NDVI at the test site in Senegal and the same “bowl-shaped” diurnal curve was found for a medium dense cover of annual grasses. The range in observed NDVI and time of diurnal minimum was different due to different viewing geometry. Daily minimum of in situ measured NDVI was around solar noon whereas minimum MSG NDVI occurs one hour prior to noon due to the test site location 12° west of the satellite sensor. Diurnal variation in observed NDVI was studied for a number of pixels characterized by different sensor view zenith angles and vegetation types. This analysis illustrated the diurnal NDVI dependency of illumination conditions, view angle and vegetation intensity and pinpoints the importance of proper BRDF modeling to produce daily values of MSG NDVI normalized for acquisition time, which will be the subject of a forthcoming paper.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This paper presents a critical review of a number of popular methods that have been developed to retrieve cloud and precipitation properties from satellite radiance measurements. The emphasis of the paper is on the retrieval uncertainties associated with these methods, as these shape future data assimilation applications, either in the form of direct radiance assimilation or assimilation of retrieved geophysical data, or even in the use of retrieved information as a source of model error characterization. It is demonstrated throughout the paper how cloud and precipitation observing systems developed around seemingly simple concepts are in fact very complex and largely underconstrained, which explains, in part, why assigning realistic errors to these properties has been so elusive in the past. Two primary sources of error that define the observing system are highlighted throughout: (i) the first source is errors associated with the identification of cloudy scenes from clear scenes and the identification of precipitation in cloudy scenes from nonprecipitating cloudy scenes. The problems of discriminating of cloud clear and cloud precipitation are illustrated using examples drawn from microwave cloud liquid water path and precipitation retrievals. (ii) The second source is errors introduced by the forward model and its related parameters. The forward model generally contains two main components: a model of the atmosphere and the cloud and precipitation structures imbedded in that atmosphere and a forward model of the radiative transfer that produces the synthetic measurement that is ultimately compared to the measurement. The vast majority of methods developed for deriving cloud and precipitation information from satellite measurements is highly sensitive to these model parameters, which merely reflects the underconstrained nature of the problem and the need for other information in deriving solutions. The cloud and precipitation retrieval examples presented in this paper are most often constructed around very unrealistic atmosphere models typically composed of just a few layers. The consequence is that the retrievals become too sensitive to the unobserved parameters of those layers and the atmosphere above and below. Clearly a better definition of the atmospheric state, and the vertical structure of clouds and precipitation, are needed to improve the information extracted from satellite observations, and it is for this reason that the combination of active and passive measurements offers much hope for improving cloud and precipitation retrievals.},

	abstract = {For agricultural applications, identification of non-photosynthetic above-ground vegetation is of great interest as it contributes to assess harvest practices, detecting crop residues or drought events, as well as to better predict the carbon, water and nutrients uptake. While the mapping of green Leaf Area Index (LAI) is well established, current operational retrieval models are not calibrated for LAI estimation over senescent, brown vegetation. This not only leads to an underestimation of LAI when crops are ripening, but is also a missed monitoring opportunity. The high spatial and temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites constellation offers the possibility to esti­ mate brown LAI (LAIB) next to green LAI (LAIG). By using LAI ground measurements from multiple campaigns associated with airborne or satellite spectra, Gaussian processes regression (GPR) models were developed for both LAIG and LAIB, providing alongside associated uncertainty estimates, which allows to mask out unreliable LAI retrievals with higher uncertainties. A processing chain was implemented to apply both models to S2 images, generating a multiband LAI product at 20 m spatial resolution. The models were adequately validated with insitu data from various European study sites (LAIG: R2 = 0.7, RMSE = 0.67 m2/m2; LAIB: R2 = 0.62, RMSE = 0.43 m2/m2). Thanks to the S2 bands in the red edge (B5: 705 nm and B6: 740 nm) and in the shortwave infrared (B12: 2190 nm) a distinction between LAIG and LAIB can be achieved. To demonstrate the capability of LAIB to identify when crops start senescing, S2 time series were processed over multiple European study sites and sea­ sonal maps were produced, which show the onset of crop senescence after the green vegetation peak. Particu­ larly, the LAIB product permits the detection of harvest (i.e., sudden drop in LAIB) and the determination of crop residues (i.e., remaining LAIB), although a better spectral sampling in the shortwave infrared would have been desirable to disentangle brown LAI from soil variability and its perturbing effects. Finally, a single total LAI product was created by merging LAIG and LAIB estimates, and then compared to the LAI derived from S2 L2B biophysical processor integrated in SNAP. The spatiotemporal analysis results confirmed the improvement of the proposed descriptors with respect to the standard SNAP LAI product accounting only for photosynthetically active green vegetation.},

	abstract = {Sentinel-2 is a very new programme of the European Space Agency (ESA) that is designed for ﬁne spatial resolution global monitoring. Sentinel-2 images provide four 10 m bands and six 20 m bands. To provide more explicit spatial information, this paper aims to downscale the six 20 m bands to 10 m spatial resolution using the four directly observed 10 m bands. The outcome of this fusion task is the production of 10 Sentinel-2 bands with 10 m spatial resolution. This new fusion problem involves four ﬁne spatial resolution bands, which is different to, and more complex than, the common pan-sharpening fusion problem which involves only one ﬁne band. To address this, we extend the existing two main families of image fusion approaches (i.e., component substitution, CS, and multiresolution analysis, MRA) with two different schemes, a band synthesis scheme and a band selection scheme. Moreover, the recently developed area-to-point regression kriging (ATPRK) approach was also developed and applied for the Sentinel-2 fusion task. Using two Sentinel-2 datasets released online, the three types of approaches (eight CS and MRA-based approaches, and ATPRK) were compared comprehensively in terms of their accuracies to provide recommendations for the task of fusion of Sentinel-2 images. The downscaled tenband 10 m Sentinel-2 datasets represent important and promising products for a wide range of applications in remote sensing. They also have potential for blending with the upcoming Sentinel-3 data for ﬁne spatio-temporal resolution monitoring at the global scale.},

	abstract = {Spectral properties of a wheat canopy with vegetation fraction (VF) from 0\% to 100\% in visible and near-infrared (NIR) ranges of the spectrum were studied in order to devise a technique for remote estimation of VF. When VF was {\textless}60\%, from emergence till middle of the elongation stage, four distinct, and quite independent, spectral bands of reflectance existed in the visible range of the spectrum: 400 to 500 nm, 530 to 600 nm, near 670 nm, and around 700 nm. When VF was between 60\% and 100\%, reflectance in the NIR leveled off or even decreases with an increase of VF. The decreased reflectance in the NIR, occurring at or near the midseason, can be a limiting factor in the use of that spectral region for VF estimation. It was found that for VF{\textgreater}60\%, the information content of reflectance spectra in visible range can be expressed by only two independent pairs of spectral bands: (1) the blue from 400 to 500 nm and the red near 670 nm; (2) the green around 550 nm and the red edge region near 700 nm. We propose using only the visible range of the spectrum to quantitatively estimate VF. The green (as well as a 700-nm band) and the red (near 670 nm) reflectances were used in developing new indices, which were linearly proportional to wheat VF ranging from 0\% to 100\%. The Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) concept was used to correct indices for atmospheric effects. Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index in the form VARI=(Rgreen−Rred)/(Rgreen+Rred−Rblue) was found to be minimally sensitive to atmospheric effects allowing estimation of VF with an error of {\textless}10\% in a wide range of atmospheric optical thickness. Validation of the newly suggested technique was carried out using wheat independent data sets and reflectance data obtained for cornfields in Nebraska. Predicted green VF was compared with retrieved from digital images. Despite the fact that the reflectance contrast among the visible channels is much smaller than between the visible and NIR, the sensitivity of suggested indices to moderate to high values of VF is much higher than for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the error in VF prediction did not exceed 10\%. Suggested indices will complement the widely used NDVI, ARVI, Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and others, which are based on the red and the NIR bands in VF estimation, and also Green Atmospherically Resistant Index (GARI), which is based on the green and the NIR bands.},

Spectral models and indices are being developed to improve vegetation sensitivity by accounting for atmosphere and soil effects. The soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was developed to minimize soil influences on canopy spectra by incorporating a soil adjustment factor L into the denominator of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) equation. For optimal adjustment of the soil effect, however, the L factor should vary inversely with the amount of vegetation present. A modified SAVI (MSAVI) that replaces the constant L in the SAVI equation with a variable L function is presented in this article. The L function may be derived by induction or by using the product of the NDVI and weighted difference vegetation index (WDVI). Results based on ground and aircraft-measured cotton canopies are presented. The MSAVI is shown to increase the dynamic range of the vegetation signal while further minimizing the soil background influences, resulting in greater vegetation sensitivity as defined by a “vegetation signal” to “soil noise” ratio.},

	abstract = {Farmers must balance the competing goals of supplying adequate N for their crops while minimizing N losses to the environment. To characterize the spatial variability of N over large fields, traditional methods (soil testing, plant tissue analysis, and chlorophyll meters) require many point samples. Because of the close link between leaf chlorophyll and leaf N concentration, remote sensing techniques have the potential to evaluate the N variability over large fields quickly. Our objectives were to (1) select wavelengths sensitive to leaf chlorophyll concentration, (2) simulate canopy reflectance using a radiative transfer model, and (3) propose a strategy for detecting leaf chlorophyll status of plants using remotely sensed data. A wide range of leaf chlorophyll levels was established in field-grown corn (Zea mays L.) with the application of 8 N levels: 0\%, 12.5\%, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, 100\%, 125\%, and 150\% of the recommended rate. Reflectance and transmittance spectra of fully expanded upper leaves were acquired over the 400-nm to 1,000-nm wavelength range shortly after anthesis with a spectroradiometer and integrating sphere. Broad-band differences in leaf spectra were observed near 550 nm, 715 nm, and {\textgreater}750 nm. Crop canopy reflectance was simulated using the SAIL (Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) canopy reflectance model for a wide range of background reflectances, leaf area indices (LAI), and leaf chlorophyll concentrations. Variations in background reflectance and LAI confounded the detection of the relatively subtle differences in canopy reflectance due to changes in leaf chlorophyll concentration. Spectral vegetation indices that combined near-infrared reflectance and red reflectance (e.g., OSAVI and NIR/Red) minimized contributions of background reflectance, while spectral vegetation indices that combined reflectances of near-infrared and other visible bands (MCARI and NIR/Green) were responsive to both leaf chlorophyll concentrations and background reflectance. Pairs of these spectral vegetation indices plotted together produced isolines of leaf chlorophyll concentrations. The slopes of these isolines were linearly related to leaf chlorophyll concentration. A limited test with measured canopy reflectance and leaf chlorophyll data confirmed these results. The characterization of leaf chlorophyll concentrations at the field scale without the confounding problem of background reflectance and LAI variability holds promise as a valuable aid for decision making in managing N applications.},

	abstract = {We evaluated the initial 12 months of vegetation index product availability from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Earth Observing System-Terra platform. Two MODIS vegetation indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations.},

	abstract = {As the spatial and temporal resolution of remotely sensed imagery has improved over the last four decades, algorithms for monitoring and mapping seasonal changes in surface properties have evolved rapidly. Most recently, the availability of daily PlanetScope imagery has created new opportunities for monitoring the land surface phenology (LSP) of terrestrial ecosystems at high spatial resolution. However, the quality and value of LSP information from PlanetScope imagery have not been systematically examined. In this paper, we evaluate the character and quality of LSP information derived from PlanetScope by comparing time series of vegetation indices and LSP metrics from PlanetScope to corresponding time series and LSP metrics derived from Harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) imagery and PhenoCams at six sites that span a diverse range of land cover types and climate. Results show that vegetation index time series from all three data sources show high temporal correlation, and LSP metrics derived from HLS, PlanetScope, and PhenoCam show high agreement with negligible bias. Semi-variograms for phenometrics estimated from PlanetScope imagery indicate that the majority of spatial variance captured in PlanetScope phenometrics occurs well below the spatial resolution HLS imagery. At the same time, LSP metrics from HLS are most strongly correlated with the 50–75\% quantiles of 3 m LSP metrics from PlanetScope. This indicates that HLS captures the average phenology at sub-pixel scale captured in PlanetScope imagery. Our results represent the first comprehensive comparison of LSP metrics estimated from PlanetScope and publicly available moderate spatial resolution imagery, and provide insights regarding: (1) the quality and character of LSP metrics derived from HLS and PlanetScope; and (2) the relative merits and trade-offs associated with the use of each data source for LSP studies.},

	abstract = {Optical earth observation (EO) satellite sensors generally suffer from drifts and biases relative to their pre-launch calibration, caused by launch and/or time in the space environment. This places a severe limitation on the fundamental reliability and accuracy that can be assigned to satellite derived information, and is particularly critical for long time base studies for climate change and enabling interoperability and Analysis Ready Data. The proposed TRUTHS (Traceable Radiometry Underpinning Terrestrial and Helio-Studies) mission is explicitly designed to address this issue through re-calibrating itself directly to a primary standard of the international system of units (SI) in-orbit and then through the extension of this SI-traceability to other sensors through in-flight cross-calibration using a selection of Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) recommended test sites. Where the characteristics of the sensor under test allows, this will result in a significant improvement in accuracy. This paper describes a set of tools, algorithms and methodologies that have been developed and used in order to estimate the radiometric uncertainty achievable for an indicative target sensor through in-flight cross-calibration using a well-calibrated hyperspectral SI-traceable reference sensor with observational characteristics such as TRUTHS. In this study, Multi-Spectral Imager (MSI) of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) is evaluated as an example, however the analysis is readily translatable to larger-footprint sensors such as Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). This study considers the criticality of the instrumental and observational characteristics on pixel level reflectance factors, within a defined spatial region of interest (ROI) within the target site. It quantifies the main uncertainty contributors in the spectral, spatial, and temporal domains. The resultant tool will support existing sensor-to-sensor cross-calibration activities carried out under the auspices of CEOS, and is also being used to inform the design specifications for TRUTHS.},

A field experiment was performed in the Guadalentin basin, Spain using matorral vegetation canopies dominated by Rosmarinus officinalis, Cistus albidus, and Anthyllis cytosoides. A spectroradiometer was used to record the reflectance of a series of sites at which measurements were made of the concentrations per unit ground area and per unit leaf mass of chlorophyll a and b and the carotenoids, together with leaf area index and percent canopy cover. A range of spectral characteristics was examined which have been found previously to be related to pigment concentrations and biophysical properties of vegetation. For matorral vegetation many of these spectral characteristics were unrelated or only weakly related to canopy properties. However, it was found that pigment concentrations per unit ground area were related to ratios of reflectance in narrow spectral bands within the near-infrared region, ratios of bands within the red region, and characteristics of the amplitude of first derivative spectra in the red edge region. Pigment concentrations per unit leaf mass were correlated with ratios of bands around the nearinfrared “shoulder” and the amplitude of the first derivative in certain visible wavelengths. LAI and percent cover were related to ratios of reflectance in narrow bands on the near-infrared plateau and red edge features of canopy reflectance spectra, as well as with the amplitude of the first derivative in the red edge and visible regions respectively.},

	abstract = {Crop phenology is critical for agricultural management, crop yield estimation, and agroecosystem assessment. Traditionally, crop growth stages are observed from the ground, which is time-consuming and lacks spatial variability. Remote sensing Vegetation Index (VI) time series has been used to map land surface phenology (LSP) and relate to crop growth stages mostly after the growing season. In recent years, high temporal and spatial resolution remote sensing data have allowed near-real-time mapping of crop phenology within the growing season. This paper summarizes two classes of near-real-time mapping methods, i.e., curve-based and trend-based approaches. The curve-based approaches combine the time series VIs and crop growth stages from historical years with the current observations to estimate crop growth stages. The curve-based approaches are capable of a short-term prediction. The trend-based approaches detect upward or downward trends from time series and confirm the trends using the increasing or decreasing momentum and VI thresholds. The trend-based approaches only use current observations. Both curve-based and trend-based approaches are promising in mapping crop growth stages timely. Nevertheless, mapping crop phenology near real-time is challenging since remote sensing observations are not always sensitive to crop growth stages. The accuracy of crop phenology detection depends on the frequency and availability of cloud-free observations within the growing season. Recent satellite datasets such as the harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) are promising for mapping crop phenology within the season over large areas. Operational applications in the near future are feasible.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Plant phenology regulates ecosystem services at local and global scales and is a sensitive indicator of global change. Estimates of phenophase transition dates, such as the start of spring or end of fall, can be derived from sensor-based time series, but must be interpreted in terms of biologically relevant events. We use the PhenoCam archive of digital repeat photography to implement a consistent protocol for visual assessment of canopy phenology at 13 temperate deciduous forest sites throughout eastern North America, and to perform digital image analysis for time-series-based estimation of phenophase transition dates. We then compare these results to remote sensing metrics of phenophase transition dates derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors. We present a new type of curve fit that uses a generalized sigmoid function to estimate phenology dates, and we quantify the statistical uncertainty of phenophase transition dates estimated using this method. Results show that the generalized sigmoid provides estimates of dates with less statistical uncertainty than other curve-fitting methods. Additionally, we find that dates derived from analysis of high-frequency PhenoCam imagery have smaller uncertainties than satellite remote sensing metrics of phenology, and that dates derived from the remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) have smaller uncertainty than those derived from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Near-surface time-series estimates for the start of spring are found to closely match estimates derived from visual assessment of leaf-out, as well as satellite remote-sensing-derived estimates of the start of spring. However late spring and fall phenology metrics exhibit larger differences between near-surface and remote scales. Differences in late spring phenology between near-surface and remote scales are found to correlate with a landscape metric of deciduous forest cover. These results quantify the effect of landscape heterogeneity when aggregating to the coarser spatial scales of remote sensing, and demonstrate the importance of accurate curve fitting and vegetation index selection when analyzing and interpreting phenology time series.},

The forthcoming Collection 6 of MODIS products will include a “second generation” Deep Blue algorithm, expanding coverage to all cloud-free and snow-free land surfaces. The Deep Blue dataset will also provide an estimate of the absolute uncertainty on AOD at 550 nm for each retrieval.

The highest quality (denoted quality assurance flag value 3) data are shown to have an absolute uncertainty of approximately (0.086+0.56τM)/AMF, where AMF is the geometric air mass factor. For a typical AMF of 2.8, this is approximately 0.03+0.20τM, comparable in quality to other satellite AOD datasets. Regional variability of retrieval performance and comparisons against Collection 5 results are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Annual maps of the remote sensing green-up date derived from SPOT-VEGETATION data were compared to the phenological observations collected by the PlantWatch citizen science project across Canada between 1998 and 2012. Green-up dates were found to relate to the leaf-out dates for four woody species (Populus tremuloides, Acer rubrum, Syringa vulgaris, Larix laricina), with a RMSE from 13.6 to 15.6days. This was true for all landcover types except in pixels where agriculture or water bodies were dominant. This is less accurate than the results from previous studies for boreal Eurasia (RMSE=8.7days), with phenology data from an operational network. When data were aggregated at a regional level, the remote sensing green-up date matched well with the interannual variations in leafing and also in flowering of most of the recorded species. These included spring events for trees, shrubs and non-woody plants which were either native to Canada or introduced. For most plants, spring flowering and leafing times are functions of accumulated temperature. For this reason, plant species develop in a predictable sequence, and interannual variations in this cohort of species leafing and flowering are correlated. This explains the correlation with remote sensing green-up. Data from this volunteer PlantWatch network proved consistent with independent satellite data, suggesting that combining the two will strengthen the future capacity to monitor vegetation changes.},

	abstract = {Information related to land surface phenology is important for a variety of applications. For example, phenology is widely used as a diagnostic of ecosystem response to global change. In addition, phenology influences seasonal scale fluxes of water, energy, and carbon between the land surface and atmosphere. Increasingly, the importance of phenology for studies of habitat and biodiversity is also being recognized. While many data sets related to plant phenology have been collected at specific sites or in networks focused on individual plants or plant species, remote sensing provides the only way to observe and monitor phenology over large scales and at regular intervals. The MODIS Global Land Cover Dynamics Product was developed to support investigations that require regional to global scale information related to spatio-temporal dynamics in land surface phenology. Here we describe the Collection 5 version of this product, which represents a substantial refinement relative to the Collection 4 product. This new version provides information related to land surface phenology at higher spatial resolution than Collection 4 (500-m vs. 1-km), and is based on 8-day instead of 16-day input data. The paper presents a brief overview of the algorithm, followed by an assessment of the product. To this end, we present (1) a comparison of results from Collection 5 versus Collection 4 for selected MODIS tiles that span a range of climate and ecological conditions, (2) a characterization of interannual variation in Collections 4 and 5 data for North America from 2001 to 2006, and (3) a comparison of Collection 5 results against ground observations for two forest sites in the northeastern United States. Results show that the Collection 5 product is qualitatively similar to Collection 4. However, Collection 5 has fewer missing values outside of regions with persistent cloud cover and atmospheric aerosols. Interannual variability in Collection 5 is consistent with expected ranges of variance suggesting that the algorithm is reliable and robust, except in the tropics where some systematic differences are observed. Finally, comparisons with ground data suggest that the algorithm is performing well, but that end of season metrics associated with vegetation senescence and dormancy have higher uncertainties than start of season metrics.},

	abstract = {Vegetation dynamics and phenology play an important role in inter-annual vegetation changes in terrestrial ecosystems and are key indicators of climate-vegetation interactions, land use/land cover changes and variation in year-to-year vegetation productivity. Satellite remote sensing data have been widely used for vegetation phenology monitoring over large geographic domains using various types of observations and methods over the past several decades. The goal of this paper is to present a detailed review of existing methods for phenology detection and emerging new techniques based on the analysis of time-series, multispectral remote sensing imagery. This paper summarizes the objective and applications of detecting general vegetation phenology stages (e.g., green onset, time or peak greenness and growing season length) often termed ‘land surface phenology’, as well as more advanced methods that estimate species-specific phenological stages (e.g., silking stage of maize). Common data processing methods, such as data smoothing, applied to prepare the time-series remote sensing observations to be applied to phenological detection methods are presented. Specific land surface phenology detection methods as well as species-specific phenology detection methods based on multispectral satellite data are then discussed. The impact of different error sources in the data on remote-sensing based phenology detection are also discussed in detail, as well as ways to reduce these uncertainties and errors. Joint analysis of multi-scale observations ranging from satellite to more recent ground-based sensors is helpful for us to understand satellite-based phenology detection mechanism and extent phenology detection to regional scale in the future. Finally, emerging opportunities to further advance remote sensing of phenology is presented that includes observations from Cubesats, near-surface observations such as PhenoCams and image data fusion techniques to improve the spatial resolution of time-series image data sets needed for phenological characterization.},

Ever-increasing big data, easy access to high-resolution imagery, and cloud-based analytics platforms like Google Earth Engine have drastically improved the ability for scientists to advance data-driven agriculture with improved algorithms for crop type mapping using remote sensing, computer vision, and machine learning. Crop type mapping techniques mainly relied on standalone SAR and optical imagery, few studies investigated the potential of SAR-optical data fusion, coupled with virtual constellation, and 3-dimensional (3D) deep learning networks. To this extent, we use a deep learning approach that utilizes the denoised backscatter and texture information from multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR data and the spectral information from multi-temporal optical Sentinel-2 data for mapping ten different crop types, as well as water, soil and urban area. Multi-temporal Sentinel-1 data was fused with multi-temporal optical Sentinel-2 data in an effort to improve classification accuracies for crop types. We compared the results of the 3D U-Net to the state-of-the-art deep learning networks, including SegNet and 2D U-Net, as well as commonly used machine learning method such as Random Forest. The results showed (1) fusing multi-temporal SAR and optical data yields higher training overall accuracies (OA) (3D U-Net 0.992, 2D U-Net 0.943, SegNet 0.871) and testing OA (3D U-Net 0.941, 2D U-Net 0.847, SegNet 0.643) for crop type mapping compared to standalone multi-temporal SAR or optical data (2) optical data fused with denoised SAR data via a denoising convolution neural network (OA 0.912) performed better for crop type mapping compared to optical data fused with boxcar (OA 0.880), Lee (OA 0.881), and median (OA 0.887) filtered SAR data and (3) 3D convolutional neural networks perform better than 2D convolutional neural networks for crop type mapping (SAR OA 0.912, optical OA 0.937, fused OA 0.992).},

	abstract = {Crop type classification using Earth Observation (EO) data is challenging, particularly for crop types with similar phenological growth stages. In this regard, the synergy of optical and Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables a broad representation of biophysical and structural information on target objects, enhancing crop type mapping. However, the fusion of multi-sensor dense time-series data often comes with the challenge of high dimensional feature space. In this study, we (1) evaluate how the usage of only optical, only SAR, and their fusion affect the classification accuracy; (2) identify the combination of which time-steps and feature-sets lead to peak accuracy; (3) analyze misclassifications based on the parcel size, optical data availability, and crops\&rsquo; temporal profiles. Two fusion approaches were considered and compared in this study: feature stacking and decision fusion. To distinguish the most relevant feature subsets time- and variable-wise, grouped forward feature selection (gFFS) was used. gFFS allows focusing analysis and interpretation on feature sets of interest like spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs), or data sensing time rather than on single features. This feature selection strategy leads to better interpretability of results while substantially reducing computational expenses. The results showed that, in contrast to most other studies, SAR datasets outperform optical datasets. Similar to most other studies, the optical-SAR combination outperformed single sensor predictions. No significant difference was recorded between feature stacking and decision fusion. Random Forest (RF) appears to be robust to high feature space dimensionality. The feature selection did not improve the accuracies even for the optical-SAR feature stack with 320 features. Nevertheless, the combination of RF feature importance and time- and variable-wise gFFS rankings in one visualization enhances interpretability and understanding of the features\&rsquo; relevance for specific classification tasks. For example, by enabling the identification of features that have high RF feature importance values but are, in their information content, correlated with other features. This study contributes to the growing domain of interpretable machine learning.},

	abstract = {In the global context of population growth and climate change, monitoring crops is necessary to sustain agriculture and conserve natural resources. While many studies have demonstrated the ability of optical and SAR remotely sensed data to estimate crop parameters, these data have not been compared or combined to predict crop phenological stages. Despite the high sensitivity of SAR polarimetric data to crop phenological stages, no study has used high temporal resolution data. The freely available SAR Sentinel-1 (S-1) and optical Sentinel-2 (S-2) time series provide a unique opportunity to monitor crop phenology at a high spatial resolution on a weekly basis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of S-1 data alone, S-2 data alone, and their combined use to predict wheat and rapeseed phenological stages. We first analyzed temporal profiles of spectral bands, vegetation indices and leaf area index (LAI) derived from S-2 data, and backscattering coefficients and polarimetric indicators derived from S-1 data. Then, an incremental procedure was used to estimate the contribution of S-1 and S-2 features to the classification of principal and secondary phenological stages of wheat and rapeseed. Results for both crops showed that the classification obtained with combined S-1 \& 2 data (mean kappa = 0.53–0.82 and 0.74–0.92 for wheat and rapeseed, respectively) was more accurate than those obtained with S-2 data alone (mean kappa = 0.54–0.75 and 0.67–0.86 for wheat and rapeseed, respectively) or S-1 data alone (mean kappa = 0.48–0.61 and 0.61–0.64 for wheat and rapeseed, respectively). Combining S-1 \& 2 data allowed better identification of the beginning and end of tillering for wheat and the beginning and end of ripening for rapeseed. Among S-2 features, the most important were LAI for wheat and the NDVI for rapeseed. For both crops, the S2REP index was one of the most important vegetation indices, while MCARI was less important. For S-1 features, results highlighted the large contribution of the backscatter ratio (σ◦VH:σ◦VV) and the value of using polarimetric indicators (Shannon entropy and span) to monitor rapeseed and wheat phenology. The main novelties of this work are the use of S-1 polarimetric indicators to identify phenological stages of wheat and rapeseed and the mapping of wheat and rapeseed secondary phenological stages using remotely sensed data.},

	abstract = {The availability of satellite optical information is often hampered by the natural presence of clouds, which can be problematic for many applications. Persistent clouds over agricultural fields can mask key stages of crop growth, leading to unreliable yield predictions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides all-weather imagery which can potentially overcome this limitation, but given its high and distinct sensitivity to different surface properties, the fusion of SAR and optical data still remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose the use of Multi-Output Gaussian Process (MOGP) regression, a machine learning technique that learns automatically the statistical relationships among multisensor time series, to detect vegetated areas over which the synergy between SAR-optical imageries is profitable. For this purpose, we use the Sentinel-1 Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and Sentinel-2 Leaf Area Index (LAI) time series over a study area in north west of the Iberian peninsula. Through a physical interpretation of MOGP trained models, we show its ability to provide estimations of LAI even over cloudy periods using the information shared with RVI, which guarantees the solution keeps always tied to real measurements. Results demonstrate the advantage of MOGP especially for long data gaps, where optical-based methods notoriously fail. The leave-one-image-out assessment technique applied to the whole vegetation cover shows MOGP predictions improve standard GP estimations over short-time gaps (R2 of 74\% vs 68\%, RMSE of 0.4 vs 0.44 [m2m−2]) and especially over long-time gaps (R2 of 33\% vs 12\%, RMSE of 0.5 vs 1.09 [m2m−2]). A second assessment is focused on crop-specific regions, clustering pixels fulfilling specific model conditions where the synergy is profitable. Results reveal the MOGP performance is crop type and crop stage dependent. For long time gaps, best R2 are obtained over maize, ranging from 0.1 (tillering) to 0.36 (development) up to 0.81 (maturity); for moderate time gap, R2  = 0.93 (maturity) is obtained. Crops such as wheat, oats, rye and barley, can profit from the LAI-RVI synergy, with R2 varying between 0.4 and 0.6. For beet or potatoes, MOGP provides poorer results, but alternative descriptors to RVI should be tested for these specific crops in the future before discarding synergy real benefits. In conclusion, active-passive sensor fusion with MOGP represents a novel and promising approach to cope with crop monitoring over cloud-dominated areas.},

	abstract = {Landsat and Sentinel-2 sensors together provide the most widely accessible medium-to-high spatial resolution multispectral data for a wide range of applications, such as vegetation phenology identification, crop yield estimation, and forest disturbance detection. Improved timely and accurate observations of the Earth's surface and dynamics are expected from the synergistic use of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, which entails coordinating the spatial resolution gap between Landsat (30 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 m or 20 m) images. However, widely used data fusion techniques may not fulfil community's needs for generating a temporally dense reflectance product at 10 m spatial resolution from combined Landsat and Sentinel-2 images because of their inherent algorithmic weaknesses. Inspired by the recent advances in deep learning, this study developed an extended super-resolution convolutional neural network (ESRCNN) to a data fusion framework, specifically for blending Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) data. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the deep learning-based fusion algorithm in yielding a consistent and comparable dataset at 10 m from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. Further accuracy assessments revealed that the performance of the fusion network was influenced by both the number of input auxiliary Sentinel-2 images and temporal interval (i.e., difference in image acquisition dates) between auxiliary Sentinel-2 images and the target Landsat-8 image. Compared to the benchmark algorithm, area-to-point regression kriging (ATKPK), the deep learning-based fusion framework proved better in the quantitative assessment in terms of RMSE (root mean square error), correlation coefficient (CC), universal image quality index (UIQI), relative global-dimensional synthesis error (ERGAS), and spectral angle mapper (SAM). ESRCNN better preserved the reflectance distribution as the original image compared to ATPRK, resulting in an improved image quality. Overall, the developed data fusion network that blends Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images has the potential to help generate continuous reflectance observations of higher temporal frequency than that can be obtained from a single Landsat-like sensor.},

We present a HIghly Scalable Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (HISTARFM) algorithm to combine multispectral images of different sensors to reduce noise and produce monthly gap free high resolution (30 m) observations over land. Our approach uses images from the Landsat (30 m spatial resolution and 16 day revisit cycle) and the MODIS missions, both from Terra and Aqua platforms (500 m spatial resolution and daily revisit cycle). We implement a bias-aware Kalman filter method in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to obtain fused images at the Landsat spatial-resolution. The added bias correction in the Kalman filter estimates accounts for the fact that both model and observation errors are temporally auto-correlated and may have a non-zero mean. This approach also enables reliable estimation of the uncertainty associated with the final reflectance estimates, allowing for error propagation analyses in higher level remote sensing products. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated products through comparison with other state-of-the-art methods confirm the validity of the approach, and open the door to operational applications at enhanced spatio-temporal resolutions at broad continental scales.},

The EO-IU subsystem is automatically generating ESA Level 2 products (scene classification map, up to basic land cover units) from optical satellite data. The EO-SQ subsystem comprises a graphical user interface (GUI) and an array database embedded in a client server model. In the array database, all EO images are stored as a space-time data cube together with their Level 2 products generated by the EO-IU subsystem. The GUI allows users to (a) develop a conceptual world model based on a graphically supported query pipeline as a combination of spatial and temporal operators and/or standard algorithms and (b) create, save and share within the client-server architecture complex semantic queries/decision rules, suitable for SCBIR and/or spatiotemporal EO image analytics, consistent with the conceptual world model.},

However, the spatial resampling operations involved by the orthorectification also transform the radiometric quality of the data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of the S2 orthorectification process on the radiometric quality of the data, with focus on the radiometric uncertainty budget. In particular, the study reports the variation of the S2 noise model attached to the S2 L1C metadata and the effects on the L1C uncertainty products produced by an offline processor named Radiometric Uncertainty Tool (RUT). This assessment is divided into three steps, namely noise propagation, interpolation uncertainty, and covariance impact. For the first of them, the results show that noise is reduced by a factor of 0.65 from L1B to L1C data, both by simulations and an empirical approach that estimates noise variance from real L1B and L1C acquisitions at different sites. Regarding the evaluation of the interpolation uncertainty, aerial orthoimages are convolved by the S2 Point Spread Function (PSF) and upsampled into the S2 spatial resolution. The study shows that, from this S2-like image, a distribution of interpolation errors (i.e. uncertainty) can be associated to the standard deviation of the neighbouring pixels. Finally, the covariance change due to the spatial resampling has been simulated with a propagation of the L1B radiance errors in order to understand the increase of correlation between neighbouring pixels.},

	abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) and chlorophyll content, at leaf and canopy level, are important variables for agricultural applications because of their crucial role in photosynthesis and in plant functioning. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that LAI, leaf chlorophyll content (LCC), and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) of a potato crop can be estimated by vegetation indices for the ﬁrst time using Sentinel-2 satellite images. In 2016 ten plots of 30 × 30 m were designed in a potato ﬁeld with different fertilization levels. During the growing season approximately 10 daily radiometric ﬁeld measurements were used to determine LAI, LCC, and CCC. These radiometric determinations were extensively calibrated against LAI2000 and chlorophyll meter (SPAD, soil plant analysis development) measurements for potato crops grown in the years 2010–2014. Results for Sentinel-2 showed that the weighted difference vegetation index (WDVI) using bands at 10 m spatial resolution can be used for estimating the LAI (R2 of 0.809; root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.36). The ratio of the transformed chlorophyll in reﬂectance index and the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (TCARI/OSAVI) showed to be a good linear estimator of LCC at 20 m (R2 of 0.696; RMSEP of 0.062 g·m−2). The performance of the chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI) at 10 m spatial resolution was slightly worse (R2 of 0.656; RMSEP of 0.066 g·m−2) compared to TCARI/OSAVI. Finally, results showed that the green chlorophyll index (CIgreen) was an accurate and linear estimator of CCC at 10 m (R2 of 0.818; RMSEP of 0.29 g·m−2). Results for CIgreen were better than for the red-edge chlorophyll index (CIred-edge, R2 of 0.576, RMSE of 0.43 g·m−2). Our results show that Sentinel-2 bands at 10 m spatial resolution are suitable for estimating LAI, LCC, and CCC, avoiding the need for red-edge bands that are only available at 20 m. This is an important ﬁnding for applying Sentinel-2 data in precision agriculture.},

	abstract = {A growing number of studies have focused on evaluating spectral indices in terms of their sensitivity to vegetation biophysical parameters, as well as to external factors affecting canopy reflectance. In this context, leaf and canopy radiative transfer models are valuable for modeling and understanding the behavior of such indices. In the present work, PROSPECT and SAILH models have been used to simulate a wide range of crop canopy reflectances in an attempt to study the sensitivity of a set of vegetation indices to green leaf area index (LAI), and to modify some of them in order to enhance their responsivity to LAI variations. The aim of the paper was to present a method for minimizing the effect of leaf chlorophyll content on the prediction of green LAI, and to develop new algorithms that adequately predict the LAI of crop canopies. Analyses based on both simulated and real hyperspectral data were carried out to compare performances of existing vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI], Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index [RDVI], Modified Simple Ratio [MSR], Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index [SAVI], Soil and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index [SARVI], MSAVI, Triangular Vegetation Index [TVI], and Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index [MCARI]) and to design new ones (MTVI1, MCARI1, MTVI2, and MCARI2) that are both less sensitive to chlorophyll content variations and linearly related to green LAI. Thorough analyses showed that the above existing vegetation indices were either sensitive to chlorophyll concentration changes or affected by saturation at high LAI levels. Conversely, two of the spectral indices developed as a part of this study, a modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2) and a modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index (MCARI2), proved to be the best predictors of green LAI. Related predictive algorithms were tested on CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager) hyperspectral images and, then, validated using ground truth measurements. The latter were collected simultaneously with image acquisition for different crop types (soybean, corn, and wheat), at different growth stages, and under various fertilization treatments. Prediction power analysis of proposed algorithms based on MCARI2 and MTVI2 resulted in agreements between modeled and ground measurement of non-destructive LAI, with coefficients of determination (r2) being 0.98 for soybean, 0.89 for corn, and 0.74 for wheat. The corresponding RMSE for LAI were estimated at 0.28, 0.46, and 0.85, respectively.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of optical indices from hyperspectral remote sensing in the assessment of vegetation biophysical variables both in forestry and agriculture. Those indices are, however, the combined response to variations of several vegetation and environmental properties, such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content, canopy shadows, and background soil reflectance. Of particular significance to precision agriculture is chlorophyll content, an indicator of photosynthesis activity, which is related to the nitrogen concentration in green vegetation and serves as a measure of the crop response to nitrogen application. This paper presents a combined modeling and indices-based approach to predicting the crop chlorophyll content from remote sensing data while minimizing LAI (vegetation parameter) influence and underlying soil (background) effects. This combined method has been developed first using simulated data and followed by evaluation in terms of quantitative predictive capability using real hyperspectral airborne data. Simulations consisted of leaf and canopy reflectance modeling with PROSPECT and SAILH radiative transfer models. In this modeling study, we developed an index that integrates advantages of indices minimizing soil background effects and indices that are sensitive to chlorophyll concentration. Simulated data have shown that the proposed index Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index/Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) is both very sensitive to chlorophyll content variations and very resistant to the variations of LAI and solar zenith angle. It was therefore possible to generate a predictive equation to estimate leaf chlorophyll content from the combined optical index derived from above-canopy reflectance. This relationship was evaluated by application to hyperspectral CASI imagery collected over corn crops in three experimental farms from Ontario and Quebec, Canada. The results presented here are from the L’Acadie, Quebec, Agriculture and AgriFood Canada research site. Images of predicted leaf chlorophyll content were generated. Evaluation showed chlorophyll variability over crop plots with various levels of nitrogen, and revealed an excellent agreement with ground truth, with a correlation of r 2 = .81 between estimated and field measured chlorophyll content data.

Since the mid-1980s, satellite data have been used to study these processes. In this paper, a new methodology to monitor global vegetation phenology from time series of satellite data is presented. The method uses series of piecewise logistic functions, which are fit to remotely sensed vegetation index (VI) data, to represent intra-annual vegetation dynamics. Using this approach, transition dates for vegetation activity within annual time series of VI data can be determined from satellite data. The method allows vegetation dynamics to be monitored at large scales in a fashion that it is ecologically meaningful and does not require pre-smoothing of data or the use of user-defined thresholds. Preliminary results based on an annual time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for the northeastern United States demonstrate that the method is able to monitor vegetation phenology with good success.},

In this study, we collected enhanced vegetation index (EVI, 250 m) from collection 6 MOD13Q1 product over the contiguous United States (CONUS) in 2007 and 2008, and generated a set of multiple spatial resolution EVI data by resampling 250 m to 2 Â 250 m and 3 Â 250 m, 4 Â 250 m, . . ., 35 Â 250 m. These EVI time series were then used to detect the start of spring season (SOS) at various spatial resolutions. Further the SOS variation across scales was examined at each coarse resolution grid (35 Â 250 m \% 8 km, refer to as reference grid) and ecoregion. Finally, the SOS scaling effects were associated with landscape fragment, proportion of primary land cover type, and spatial variability of seasonal greenness variation within each reference grid. The results revealed the inﬂuences of satellite spatial resolutions on SOS retrievals and the related impact factors. Speciﬁcally, SOS signiﬁcantly varied lineally or logarithmically across scales although the relationship could be either positive or negative. The overall SOS values averaged from spatial resolutions between 250 m and 35 Â 250 m at large ecosystem regions were generally similar with a difference less than 5 days, while the SOS values within the reference grid could differ greatly in some local areas. Moreover, the standard deviation of SOS across scales in the reference grid was less than 5 days in more than 70\% of area over the CONUS, which was smaller in northeastern than in southern and western regions. The SOS scaling effect was signiﬁcantly associated with heterogeneity of vegetation properties characterized using land landscape fragment, proportion of primary land cover type, and spatial variability of seasonal greenness variation, but the latter was the most important impact factor.},

To address this gap, we compared remote sensing methodologies using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery to extensive ﬁeld measurements in a mixed northern hardwood forest. Five vegetation indices, ﬁve mathematical ﬁts to model a continuous temporal response, and a suite of threshold estimates for “start of spring/season” (SOS) assessments were compared to ﬁeld measurements of bud burst stage and hemispherical photo derived canopy structural metrics (transparency, leaf area index, greenness). Results indicated that a four-parameter logistic model based on at least ﬁve spring coverages of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and a SOS threshold of 0.3 was most closely related to ﬁeld metrics and most accurate in predicting the date of full leaf out. Plot level SOS was predicted with a mean absolute error of 11 days for all species and elevation combinations, but improved to 9 days for hardwood dominated plots and 7 days for sugar maple dominated plots. Mean absolute error was improved to 8 days when forest type (mixed, conifer hardwood) was used to reﬁne predictions. The consistency of prediction errors across forest types indicates that while overall accuracy across pixels may be low, inter-annual comparisons of changes in phenology on a pixel basis may provide accurate assessments of changes in phenology over time. This was conﬁrmed by application to seven years of independent phenology data predicted with 12 days of mean absolute error. However, image availability will be a limiting factor in areas of frequent cloud cover.},

Yet current efforts to characterize phenological processes are limited by remote sensing challenges and lack of uncertainty estimates. Here, for a global distribution of phenologically and climatically similar phenoregions, we used the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer to develop a conceptually and computationally simple technique for real-time and forecast applications. Our overall approach was to analyze the phenological behavior of groups of pixels without recourse to smoothing or fitting. We used a 3-step initial process: (1) define a phenoregion specific normalized difference vegetation index threshold; (2) for all days from 1982–2003, calculate the percent of pixels above the threshold (PAT); (3) calculate daily 1982–2003 empirical distributions of PAT. For real-time monitoring, the current PAT may then be compared to the historical range of variability and visualized in relation to user-defined levels. Using similar concepts, we projected daily PAT up to one month in the future and compared predicted and actual dates at which a hypothetical PAT was reached. We found that the maximum lead-time of phenological forecasts could be analytically defined for userspecified uncertainty levels. The approach is adaptable to different remote sensing technologies and provides a foundation for ascribing a sequence of ground conditions (e.g. snowmelt, vegetative growth, pollen production, insect phenology) to remotely sensed land surface phenology observations.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a computationally fast and accurate technique for the atmospheric correction of satellite measurements in the solar spectrum. The main advantage of the method is that it is several hundred times faster than more detailed radiative transfer models like 5S and that it does not require precalculated look-up tables. The method is especially useful for correcting the huge amounts of data acquired by large-field-of-view high-repetitivity sensors, like the ones on board polar orbiting and geostationary meteorological satellites. The technique is based on a set of equations with coefficients which depend on the spectral band of the sensor. Semi-empirical formulations are used to describe the different interactions (absorption, scattering, etc.) of solar radiation with atmospheric constituents during its traverse through the atmosphere. Sensor specific coefficients of each equation are determined using a best fit technique against the computations of the 5S code (Simulation of Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum, Tame et al. 1990). Other radiative transfer models could be used. Once coefficients for a specific spectral band are determined, the inputs of the model arc vertically integrated gaseous contents, aerosol optical depth at 550 nm, geometric conditions and reflectance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). TOA reflectances were calculated using our method and then compared to the TOA reflectances calculated by 5S for a wide range of gaseous and aerosol contents, illumination and observation conditions for various sensor spectral bands. In the case of NOAA-9 AVHRR visible data the maximum relative error is 2·35 per cent (i.e. 0·01 for a reflectance value of 0,4) and the corresponding rmse is 0·0018. For NOAA-9 AVHRR near-infrared, Meteosat-I visible, Landsat-5 TM band I and Landsat-5 TM band 4 the maximum relative errors are 3·11, 4'0, 1·65 and 2'37per cent respectively. The corresponding values of the rmse are 0·0022, 0·0015,0,0017 and 0·0012. The method can be used both in the direct and in the inverse mode, i.e., to compute TOA reflectance knowing the surface reflectance (e.g., for fast sensitivity studies), or conversely to retrieve surface reflectance from the TOA reflectance. It can easily be implemented in operational data preprocessing computer code, since only band specific coefficients need to be updated when new sensors are flown, while the routines remain the same.},

This paper presents 6S (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum), a computer code which can accurately simulate the above problems. The 6S code is an improved version of 5S (Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum), developed by the Laboratoire d’Optique Atmospherique ten years ago. The new version now permits calculations of near-nadir (down-looking) aircraft observations, accounting for target elevation, non lambertian surface conditions, and new absorbing species (CH4, N2O, CO). The computational accuracy for Rayleigh and aerosol scattering effects has been improved by the use of state-of-theart approximations and implementation of the successive order of scattering (SOS) algorithm. The step size (resolution) used for spectral integration has been improved to 2.5 nm. The goal of this paper is not to provide a complete description of the methods used as that information is detailed in the 6S manual, but rather to illustrate the impact of the improvements between 5S and 6S by examining some typical remote sensing situations. Nevertheless, the 6S code has still limitations. It cannot handle spherical atmosphere and as a result, it cannot be used for limb observations. In addition, the decoupling we are using for absorption and scattering effects does not allow to use the code in presence of strong absorption bands.},

Eventually, 12 participants applied their approaches to various Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 image datasets acquired over sites around the world. The current results diverge depending on the sensors, products, and sites, indicating their strengths and weaknesses. Indeed, this ﬁrst implementation of processor inter-comparison was proven to be a good lesson for the developers to learn the advantages and limitations of their approaches.

In this study, the Sentinel-2A surface reﬂectance was generated using the Sentinel-2 atmospheric correction (Sen2Cor) processor. To evaluate this dataset, surface data at 40 sites of the aerosol robotic network over North America from January 2016 to August 2017 were collected and processed. The surface reﬂectance reference was derived from the second simulation of the satellite signal in the solar spectrum–vector (6SV) code. The aerosol optical thickness (AOT), water vapor, surface reﬂectance, and three spectral indices generated by Sen2Cor were evaluated using the metrics including the accuracy, precision, and uncertainty (A, P, and U). The results show that due to the limitations of Sen2Cor aerosol retrieval algorithm, the Sentinel-2A AOT was signiﬁcantly overestimated, with the relative accuracy over 160\%. The Sen2Cor surface reﬂectance is generally overestimated, especially for the bright pixels, except for the cirrus band. For the 12 Sentinel-2A bands, the mean values of relative A, P, and U are 4.15\%, 13.44\%, and 14.92\%, respectively. Among the three spectral indices, the normalized difference vegetation index performs best, with a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.973 against the surface data. Furthermore, the Sen2Cor surface reﬂectance was compared with other satellite products. The mean correlation coefﬁcient between Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 surface reﬂectance is found to be 0.761. This study suggests that a better AOT retrieval is critical for improvement of Sen2Cor in the future.},

	abstract = {An algorithm is developed for automatic atmospheric correction of satellite imagery of the Earth's surface. The algorithm is based solely on the satellite image being corrected and on climatology of the area. It is applicable to low resolution (I km field of view) and high resolution (l0-80m field of view) imagery of land areas for the solar spectrum. The algorithm requires that some pixels in the image will correspond to dense dark vegetation as the surface cover. Once the presence of such pixels is established, the algorithm automatically chooses these pixels, derives the atmospheric optical thickness (a measure of the amount of haze) and corrects the image. The algorithm is sensitive to the assumed reflectance of the dense dark vegetation. As a result. the accuracy of the corrected surface reflectance (p) is expected to be I'{\textgreater}.p= ±0·01. It is not very sensitive to the assumed aerosol characteristics, the accuracy of satellite calibration or the knowledge of the exact fraction of the image covered by the dense dark vegetation. The correction algorithm was applied to clear and hazy Landsat Multispectral Scanner images of the same area in the Washington D.C. and the Chesapeake Bay region. The aerosol optical thickness (r,) derived from the imagery shows a good agreement with simultaneous sunphotometer measurements from the ground within I'{\textgreater}.r,= ±0·20 in band I (0,5-0,6 I'm) and I'{\textgreater}.r,= ±0·05 in band 2 (0·6-0' 7I'm). The images in the hazy and clear days were corrected and compared. The comparison shows, for example, that the vegetation index was corrected from O· 39 in the clear day and 0·21 in the hazy day to 0·57 ± 0·01 in these two days. The algorithm, in its present form, can be applied to satellite imagery that includes at least two channels in the visible part of the spectrum, preferably blue and red. Application to the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer type of sensor (with one broad channel in the visible part of the spectrum) would need some modifications.},

	abstract = {Airborne and orbital imaging spectroscopy can facilitate the quantification of chemical and physical attributes of surface materials through analysis of spectral signatures. Prior to analysis, estimates of surface reflectance must be inferred from radiance measurements in a process known as atmospheric correction, which compensates for the distortion of the electromagnetic signal by the atmosphere. Inaccuracies in the correction process can alter characteristic spectral signatures, leading to subsequent mischaracterization of surface properties. Global ob­ servations pose new challenges for mapping surface composition, as varied atmospheric conditions and surface biomes challenge traditional atmospheric correction methods. Recent work adopted an optimal estimation (OE) approach for retrieving surface reflectance from observed radiance measurements, providing the reflectance estimates with a posterior probability. This work incorporates these input probabilities to improve the accuracy of surface feature measurements. We demonstrate this using a generic feature-fitting method that is applicable to a wide range of Earth surface studies including geology, ecosystem studies, hydrology and urban studies. Specifically, we use a probabilistic framework based on generalized Tikhonov-regularized least squares, a rig­ orous formulation for appropriate weighting of features by their observation uncertainty and leveraging of prior knowledge of material abundance for improving estimation accuracy. We demonstrate the validity of this procedure and quantify the increase in model performance by simulating expected accuracies in the reflectance estimation. To evaluate global uncertainties in mineral estimation, we simulate observations representative of the expected global range of atmospheric water vapor and aerosol levels, and characterize the sensitivity of our procedure to those quantities.},

	abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) is a plant development indicator that as an input parameter strongly inﬂuences several relevant hydrological processes represented in Soil–Vegetation–Atmosphere-Transfer (SVAT) models. Generally, temporal measurement or monitoring of LAI is challenging or even impossible in remote areas. High-temporal resolution remote sensing imaging can be used to estimate LAI from vegetation indices calculated from band ratios. This paper shows the sensitivity of LAI estimation from satellite imaging to atmospheric correction (with ATCOR) and evaluates the effects of LAI uncertainty on water balance modelling. LAI as a SVAT model input parameter was estimated based on the empirical relationship between ﬁeld measurements, and the vegetation indices NDVI (Normalized-Difference Vegetation Index), SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) and SARVI (Soil–Atmosphere Resistant Vegetation Index) for six RapidEye images obtained between 2011 and 2012. In summary, we found that the ATCOR parameter ‘visibility’ has the strongest inﬂuence on LAI estimation. Likewise, atmospherically corrected successive images gathered from around the same time period had low LAI differences (mean absolute difference of 0.09 ± 0.08) on overlapping image areas. This uncertainty is negligible in SVAT modelling in most cases, thereby allowing mosaicked successive atmospherically corrected images to be used. We showed that LAI uncertainties arising from atmospheric correction (ATCOR 3) can translate into small (LAI ± 0.1 ≈ evapotranspiration ± 0.9\%, interception ± 2.5\%, evaporation ± 3.3\%, transpiration ± 0.7\%) to moderate (LAI ± 0.3 ≈ evapotranspiration ± 4.1\%, interception ± 7.5\%, evaporation ± 9.9\%, transpiration ± 2.4\%) SVAT model uncertainty.},

Both Fully Constrained Least Squares (FCLS) and FCLS with Total Variation (FCLS-TV) are applied. We use ﬁve simulated datasets contaminated by various noise levels. Three datasets cover two spectral scenarios with diﬀerent endmembers. A univariate and a bivariate analysis are carried out on CWV and AOD. The other two datasets are used to analyze the eﬀect of surface albedo. The analysis identiﬁes trends in performance degradation caused by the gradual shift in parameter values from their true value. The maximum achievable performance depends upon spectral characteristics of the datasets, noise level, and surface albedo. As expected, under noisy conditions FCLS-TV performs better than FCLS. Our research opens new perspectives for applications where estimation of reﬂectance is so far considered to be deterministic.},

	abstract = {Many of the undernourished people on the planet obtain their entitlements to food via agricultural-based livelihood strategies, often on underperforming croplands and smallholdings. In this context, expanding cropland extent is not a viable strategy for smallholders to meet their food needs. Therefore, attention must shift to increasing productivity on existing plots and ensuring yield gaps do not widen. Thus, supporting smallholder farmers to sustainably increase the productivity of their lands is one part of a complex solution to realizing universal food security. However, the information (e.g., location and causes of cropland underperformance) required to support measures to close yield gaps in smallholder landscapes are often not available. This paper reviews the potential of crop phenology, observed from satellites carrying remote sensing sensors, to ﬁll this information gap. It is suggested that on a theoretical level phenological approaches can reveal greater intra-cropland thematic detail, and increase the accuracy of crop extent maps and crop yield estimates. However, on a practical level the spatial mismatch between the resolution at which crop phenology can be estimated from satellite remote sensing data and the scale of yield variability in smallholder croplands inhibits its use in this context. Similarly, the spatial coverage of remote sensing-derived phenology offers potential for integration with ancillary spatial datasets to identify causes of yield gaps. To reﬂect the complexity of smallholder cropping systems requires ancillary datasets at ﬁne spatial resolutions which, often, are not available. This further precludes the use of crop phenology in attempts to unpick the causes of yield gaps. Research agendas should focus on generating ﬁne spatial resolution crop phenology, either via data fusion or through new sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2) in smallholder croplands. This has potential to transform the applied use of remote sensing in this context.},

	abstract = {The European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) provides global coverage 10 m to 60 m optical wavelength data in ﬁxed geolocated tiles. Recently, it became apparent that when multi-temporal Sentinel-2A tile acquisitions are compared, they can be misregistered by more than one 10 m pixel. This study quantiﬁes the multi-temporal misregistration by application of a recently published matching algorithm to all the available Sentinel-2A data sensed in six months (June 2nd to November 30th 2016) over 1400 × 3000 km of southern Africa. The Sentinel-2A L1C tile product processing software was updated by ESA on June 15th 2016. The results of our analysis show that the update reduced the mean multi-temporal Sentinel-2A tile misregistration from about 1.6 10 m pixels (standard deviation {\textgreater} 0.9 pixels) to 0.4 10 m pixels (standard deviation of about 0.2 pixels). Future updates to the ESA L1C tile product processing software are expected to further reduce this misregistration error. Meanwhile, users should exercise care when using multi-temporal Sentinel-2A data for applications that require precise sub-pixel registration. In solution, an orbit-based registration methodology that uses a least-squares adjustment applied to matches derived among Sentinel-2A tile acquisitions sensed in diﬀerent orbits is described and demonstrated. For all the tile acquisitions in an orbit in a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) map projection zone, they are registered in the same manner, meaning that there are no relative shifts among the tile acquisitions from the same orbit in the registered data, and that the tile acquisitions that are obscured by cloud or that have a large amount of missing data can still be registered. Over 97\% of the study data, including the data sensed before June 15th 2016, were registered. The mean tile registration precision was better than 0.15 10 m pixels (standard deviation 0.06 pixels) and is shown qualitatively to provide multi-temporal data with no visually obvious misregistration at 10 m resolution.},

	abstract = {The Simplified Level 2 Product Prototype Processor (SL2P) for estimating Leaf Area index (LAI), fraction of vegetation cover (fCover) and Canopy Water Content (CWC) from Sentinel-2/MSI and Landsat-8/OLI data was validated over an agricultural region. In-situ data collected during the SMAP Validation Experiment 2016 field campaign were used as a reference. SL2P processor performance varied substantially between crop type and biophysical variable. Over all crops, SL2P underestimated in-situ LAI and CWC measurements when using either MSI (slope (bias) of 0.70 (−0.37) for LAI and 0.42 (−0.37 kg/m2) for CWC) or OLI (slope (bias) of 0.59 (−1.21) for LAI and 0.24 (−0.23 kg/m2) for CWC) data. The accuracy of SL2P fCover estimates, over all crops, was higher (slope (bias) of 0.99 (1.84\%) using MSI and 0.93 (−3.75\%) using OLI). The RMSE between biophysical variables estimated using SL2P from MSI (OLI) in comparison to in-situ data was 0.98 (1.63) for LAI, 11.39\% (10.95\%) for fCover and 0.66 kg/m2 (0.96 kg/m2) for CWC. Slightly better results are generally obtained using locally calibrated vegetation indices models, when compared to SL2P estimates using the corresponding sensor data. Uncertainty metrics of vegetation biophysical variables derived from both MSI and OLI, when compared to interpolated in-situ data time series, are found comparable to results obtained for cross-validation suggesting the possibility of using interpolated in-situ data time series for validating decametric resolution remote sensing products sparsely sampled in time.},

	abstract = {In the framework of the European Copernicus programme, the European Space Agency (ESA) has launched the Sentinel-2 (S2) Earth Observation (EO) mission which provides optical high spatial resolution imagery over land and coastal areas. As part of this mission, a tool (named S2-RUT, from Sentinel-2 Radiometric Uncertainty Tool) has been developed. The tool estimates the radiometric uncertainty associated with each pixel in the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reﬂectance factor images provided by ESA. This paper describes the design and development process of the initial version of the S2-RUT tool. The initial design step describes the S2 radiometric model where a set of uncertainty contributors are identiﬁed. Each of the uncertainty contributors is speciﬁed by reviewing the preand post-launch characterisation. The identiﬁed uncertainty contributors are combined following the guidelines in the ‘Guide to Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement’ (GUM) model and this combination model is further validated by comparing the results to a multivariate Monte Carlo Method (MCM). In addition, the correlation between the different uncertainty contributions and the impact of simpliﬁcations in the combination model have been studied. The software design of the tool prioritises an efﬁcient strategy to read the TOA reﬂectance factor images, extract the auxiliary information from the metadata in the satellite products and the codiﬁcation of the resulting uncertainty image. This initial version of the tool has been implemented and integrated as part of the Sentinels Application Platform (SNAP).},

Changes in vegetation dynamics have been strongly linked to the variability of climate patterns and may have an important impact on the ecological processes of ecosys­ tems, such as the land surface-atmosphere exchange of water and carbon, energy flows and interaction between different species. Land surface phenology (LSP) is the study of seasonal patterns in plant phenophases based on time series from vegetation indices (VI) or biophysical variables derived from satellite data, and has played an essential role in monitoring the response of terrestrial ecosystems to environmental changes from local to global scales. The goal of this systematic literature review is to provide a detailed synthesis of the main contributions of the global LSP research to the development of environmental knowledge and remote sensing science and technology, identifying possible gaps that could be addressed in the coming years.},

	abstract = {The Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel-2 (HLS) project aims to generate a seamless surface reﬂectance product by combining observations from USGS/NASA Landsat-8 and ESA Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellites. These satellites’ sampling characteristics provide nearly constant observation geometry and low illumination variation through the scene. However, the illumination variation throughout the year impacts the surface reﬂectance by producing higher values for low solar zenith angles and lower reﬂectance for large zenith angles. In this work, we present a model to derive the bidirectional reﬂectance distribution function (BRDF) normalization and apply it to the HLS product at 30 m spatial resolution. It is based on the BRDF parameters estimated from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reﬂectance product (M\{O,Y\}D09) at 1 km spatial resolution using the VJB method (Vermote et al., 2009). Unsupervised classiﬁcation (segmentation) of HLS images is used to disaggregate the BRDF parameters to the HLS spatial resolution and to build a BRDF parameters database at HLS scale. We ﬁrst test the proposed BRDF normalization for different solar zenith angles over two homogeneous sites, in particular one desert and one Peruvian Amazon forest. The proposed method reduces both the correlation with the solar zenith angle and the coefﬁcient of variation (CV) of the reﬂectance time series in the red and near infrared bands to 4\% in forest and keeps a low CV of 3\% to 4\% for the deserts. Additionally, we assess the impact of the view zenith angle (VZA) in an area of the Brazilian Amazon forest close to the equator, where impact of the angular variation is stronger because it occurs in the principal plane. The directional reﬂectance shows a strong dependency with the VZA. The current HLS BRDF correction reduces this dependency but still shows an under-correction, especially in the near infrared, while the proposed method shows no dependency with the view angles. We also evaluate the BRDF parameters using ﬁeld surface albedo measurements as a reference over seven different sites of the US surface radiation budget observing network (SURFRAD) and ﬁve sites of the Australian OzFlux network.},

Based on the assumptions that NDVI time-series follow annual cycles of growth and decline of vegetation, and that clouds or poor atmospheric conditions usually depress NDVI values, we have developed in the present study a simple but robust method based on the Savitzky – Golay filter to smooth out noise in NDVI time-series, specifically that caused primarily by cloud contamination and atmospheric variability. Our method was developed to make data approach the upper NDVI envelope and to reflect the changes in NDVI patterns via an iteration process. From the results obtained by applying the newly developed method to a 10-day MVC SPOT VGT-S product, we provide optimized parameters for the new method and compare this technique with the BISE algorithm and Fourier-based fitting method. Our results indicate that the new method is more effective in obtaining high-quality NDVI time-series.},

	abstract = {The satellite observed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series, which describe the temporal and spatial variability of global terrestrial vegetation, are inevitably contaminated by clouds, aerosol, snow and ice cover. In general all these conditions yield negative deviations in the time series of NDVI. Many time series reconstruction models have been developed to eliminate effect of the negative deviations and most of them perform differently in different applications and regions. The Harmonic Analysis (HA), Double logistic (DL), Asymmetric Gaussian (AG), Whittaker smoother (WS) and Savitzky–Golay ﬁlter (SG) are ﬁve of the most widely used time series reconstruction models owing to their simplicity of implementation or the capability to extract phenological metrics from the time series. The performance of these models varies with the NDVI signal and the noise distribution, however, and until now there is no consensus on which method outperforms all others under all situations. Since the NDVI signal and the noise distribution are highly dependent on regional climate and land cover, the reconstruction performance is expected to be spatially variable. Thus this study compared the ﬁve reconstruction models at pixel scale to provide practical and biome – speciﬁc recommendations for future time series reconstruction applications. Speciﬁcally, the 14 years raw daily reﬂectance data and ancillary Quality Assessment (QA) information from the MODIS sensor were used to generate pixel reference series and noisy series. Then the ﬁve candidate models were applied to both reference series and noisy series and three reconstruction performance metrics i.e. Overall Reconstruction Error (ORE), Fitting Related Error (FRE), and Normalized Noise Related Error (NNRE), were calculated. Finally, the performance of the ﬁve candidate reconstruction models was evaluated by applying the three metrics. The preliminary results showed that when considering ORE only, the Asymmetric Gaussian model outperforms other models over most areas of high latitude boreal region, while the Savitzky–Golay model gives the best reconstruction performance in tropical and subtropical regions. The FRE and the NNRE helped to reveal the main error sources in the reconstruction in different regions. The comparison method developed and applied in this study led to suggest adaptive selection of the best reconstruction model for speciﬁc NDVI signals and noise distribution.},

So far no systematic study on the accuracy of such reconstruction has been done. This study aims at taking the global MODIS vegetation index as an example to develop a generic method to evaluate the reconstruction performance of HANTS. The overall reconstruction error was divided into gap related error and ﬁtting-method related error. Firstly, ten annual NDVI time series for a pixel were used to extract reference series and gap statistics. Then the gap and ﬁtting-method related errors were quantiﬁed independently. The results suggest that the gap related error for most of the high latitude forest area (between 50°N and 70°N) was rather large (the mean root mean squared deviation (RMSD) reached to 0.15), which may be attributed to the fact that large gaps appear in the NDVI proﬁles between snow melting and vegetation regreening season. The gap related error was found negligible for the other areas of the globe except the North China Plain, the North India and several mountainous areas where the mean RMSD is around 0.1. The inadequate capability of low frequency harmonics to capture the rapid transition during snowmelt in spring at the high latitude region of the North Hemisphere makes the ﬁtting-method related error in this region rather large (RMSD can reach 0.1). The method developed in this study was applied to map globally the spatial pattern of HANTS performance in the reconstruction of NDVI time series and it can also be applied to evaluate the reconstruction performance of time series of other land surface variables or the performance of other time series reconstruction algorithms.},

This characteristic becomes relevant in the agricultural analysis, where availability of dense SITS is required to map and analyze fast working crop behaviors. In the literature, several methods exist that extract phenological parameters for agricultural analysis, but none of them is able to deal with irregularly sampled data. Thus, this paper presents an approach for derivation of cropland phenological parameters from irregularly sampled S2-SITS. Experimental results obtained on S2-SITS acquired over Barrax, Spain, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Accurate determination of phenological information of crops is essential for ﬁeld management and decision-making. Remote sensing time-series data are widely used for extracting phenological phases. Existing methods mainly extract phenological phases directly from individual remote sensing time-series, which are easily affected by clouds, noise, and mixed pixels. This paper proposes a novel method of phenological phase extraction based on the time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) algorithm using MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 5-day time-series data with a spatial resolution of 500 m. Firstly, based on the phenological differences between winter wheat and other land cover types, winter wheat distribution is extracted using the TWDTW classiﬁcation method, and the results show that the overall classiﬁcation accuracy and Kappa coefﬁcient reach 94.74\% and 0.90, respectively. Then, we extract the pure winter-wheat pixels using a method based on the coefﬁcient of variation, and use these pixels to generate the average phenological curve. Next, the difference between each winter-wheat phenological curve and the average winter-wheat phenological curve is quantitatively calculated using the TWDTW algorithm. Finally, the key phenological phases of winter wheat in the study area, namely, the green-up date (GUD), heading date (HD), and maturity date (MD), are determined. The results show that the phenological phase extraction using the TWDTW algorithm has high accuracy. By veriﬁcation using phenological station data from the Meteorological Data Sharing Service System of China, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the GUD, HD, and MD are found to be 9.76, 5.72, and 6.98 days, respectively. Additionally, the method proposed in this article is shown to have a better extraction performance compared with several other methods. Furthermore, it is shown that, in Hebei Province, the GUD, HD, and MD are mainly affected by latitude and accumulated temperature. As the latitude increases from south to north, the GUD, HD, and MD are delayed, and for each 1◦ increment in latitude, the GUD, HD, and MD are delayed by 4.84, 5.79, and 6.61 days, respectively. The higher the accumulated temperature, the earlier the phenological phases occur. However, latitude and accumulated temperature have little effect on the length of the phenological phases. Additionally, the lengths of time between GUD and HD, HD and MD, and GUD and MD are stable at 46, 41, and 87 days, respectively. Overall, the proposed TWDTW method can accurately determine the key phenological phases of winter wheat at a regional scale using remote sensing time-series data.},

	abstract = {Satellite-derived phenology (or apparent phenology) is frequently used to illustrate changes in plant phenology (i.e. true phenology) and the effects of climate forcing. However, each study uses a different method to detect phenology. Plant phenology refers to the relationship between the life cycle of plants and weather and climate events. Phenology is often studied in the field, but recently studies have transitioned towards using satellite images to monitor phenology at the plot, country, and continental scales. The problem with this approach is that there is an ever-increasing variety of earth observation satellites collecting data with different spatial, spectral, and temporal characteristics. In this paper we ask if studies that detect phenology using different sensors over the same site produce comparable results. Mangrove forests are one example where different methods have been used to examine their apparent phenology. In general, plant phenology, including mangroves, is described using few individual plants, but continental-scale descriptions of phenological events are scarce or inexistent. Few attempts have been made to describe the phenology of mangroves using satellite imagery, and each study pre­ sents a different method. We hypothesize that apparent phenology changes with: 1) areal extent; 2) site location; 3) frequency of observation; 4) spatial resolution; 5) temporal coverage; and 6) the number of cloud contami­ nated observations. Intuitively, one would assume that these hypotheses hold true, yet few studies have inves­ tigated this. For example, one would expect that clouds change the observed phenology of vegetation, that the number of species captured at spatial resolution will impact the apparent phenology, or that mangroves in different places display different phenologies, but how are these changes represented in the apparent phenology? We use the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) to examine the changes in the start of season and peak growing season dates, as well as the shape and amplitude of the apparent phenology in each hypothesis. We use Landsat and Sentinel 2 imagery over the mangrove forests in Darwin Harbour (Northern Territory, Australia) as a case study, and found that apparent phenology does change with the sensor, site, and cloud contamination. Impor­ tantly, the apparent phenology is comparable between Landsat and Sentinel 2 sensors, but it is not comparable to phenology derived from MODIS. This is due to differences in the spatial resolution of the sensors. Cloud contamination also significantly changes the apparent phenology of vegetation. In this paper we expose the complexity of modelling phenology with remote sensing and help guide future phenology investigations.},

	abstract = {Statistical time series models are increasingly being used to ﬁt medium resolution time series provided by satellite sensors, such as Landsat, for terrestrial monitoring. Cloud and shadows, combined with low satellite repeat cycles, reduce surface observation availability. In addition, only a single year of data can be used where there is high inter-annual variation, for example, over many croplands. These factors reduce the ability to ﬁt time series models and reduce model ﬁtting accuracy. In solution, we propose a novel ﬁll-and-ﬁt (FF) approach for application to medium resolution satellite time series. In the ‘ﬁll’ step, gaps are ﬁlled using a recently published algorithm developed to ﬁll large-area gaps in satellite time series using no other satellite data. In the ‘ﬁt’ step, a linear harmonic model is ﬁtted to the gap-ﬁlled time series. The FF approach, and the conventional harmonic model ﬁtting without gap ﬁlling, termed the F approach, are demonstrated using seven months of Landsat-7 and -8 surface reﬂectance Analysis Ready Data (ARD) over agricultural regions in North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, and Kansas. Synthetic model-predicted reﬂectance for days through the growing season are examined, and assessed quantitatively by comparison with an independent Landsat surface reﬂectance data set. The six Landsat reﬂective band root-mean-square diﬀerence (RMSD) between the predicted and the independent reﬂectance, considering millions of pixel observations for each ARD tile, show that the FF approach is more accurate than the F approach. The mean FF RMSD values varied from 0.025 to 0.026 for the four tiles, whereas the mean F RMSD values varied from 0.026 to 0.047. These mean FF RMSD values are {\textless} 0.03 which is comparable to the uncertainty speciﬁcation for the Landsat 8 OLI TOA reﬂectance, but greater than the atmospheric correction uncertainty in any Landsat 8 OLI band. The greatest RMSD values were found over the Minnesota tile and occurred due to a long period of missing data early in the growing season, and the smallest RMSD values were found for the Kansas tile because of the high availability of clear surface observations. The F approach could not be applied where there were insuﬃcient clear surface observations to ﬁt the model, and where the model was applied, the ﬁtting was often sensitive to issues including gaps in the Landsat time series and the presence of undetected cloud- and shadow-contaminated observations. The FF approach could be applied to every ARD tile pixel location and the predicted reﬂectance was spatially-coherent and natural looking. Examples are shown that illustrate the potential of using FF predicted synthetic reﬂectance time series for land surface monitoring.},

	abstract = {Radiative transfer models (RTMs) of vegetation canopies can be applied for the retrieval of numerical values of vegetation properties from satellite data. For such retrieval, it is necessary ﬁrst to apply atmospheric correction to translate the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) satellite data into top-of-canopy (TOC) values. This atmospheric correction typically assumes a Lambertian surface reﬂection, which introduces errors if the real surface is nonLambertian. Furthermore, atmospheric correction requires atmospheric characterization as input, which is not always available. In this study, we present an RTM for soil-plant-atmosphere systems to model TOC and TOA reﬂectance as observed by sensors, and to retrieve vegetation properties directly from TOA reﬂectance skipping the atmosphere correction processes with the inversion mode of the RTM. The model uses three computationally eﬃcient RTMs for soil (BSM), vegetation canopies (PROSAIL) and atmosphere (SMAC), respectively. The submodels are coupled by using the four-stream theory and the adding method. The resulting ‘Soil-PlantAtmosphere Radiative Transfer model’ (SPART) simulates directional TOA spectral observations, with all major eﬀects included, such as sun-observer geometries and non-Lambertian reﬂectance of the land surface. A sensitivity anaylsis of the model shows that neglecting anisotropic reﬂection of the surface in coupling the surface with atmosphere causes considerable errors in TOA reﬂectance. The model was validated by comparing TOC and TOA reﬂectance simulations with those simulated with the atmosphere-included version of the DART RTM model. We show that the diﬀerences between DART and SPART are less than 7\% for simulating TOC reﬂectance, and are less than 20\% (less than 10\% at most bands) for simulating TOA reﬂectance. The model performance in retrieving key vegetation and atmospheric properties was evaluted by using a synthetic dataset and a satellite dataset. The inversion mode allows estimating vegetation properties along with atmospheric properties and TOC reﬂectance with reasonable accuracy directly from TOA observations, and remarkable accuracy can be achieved if prior information is used in the model inversion. The model can be used to investigate the sensitivity of surface and atmospheric properties on TOC and TOA reﬂectance and for the simulation of synthetic data of existing and forthcoming satellite missions. More importantly, it facilitates a quantitative use of remote sensing data from satellites directly without the need for atmospheric correction.},

	abstract = {Much research has focused on the use of intensive grid soil sampling and yield monitors to identify within-field spatial variability in precision farming. This paper reports on the use of airborne videography to identify spatial plant growth patterns for grain sorghum. Color-infrared ŽCIR. digital video images were acquired from two grain sorghum fields in south Texas several times during the 1995 and 1996 growing seasons. The video images were registered, and classified into several zones of homogeneous spectral response using an unsupervised classification procedure. Ground truthing was performed upon a limited number of sites within each zone to determine plant density, plant height, leaf area index, biomass, and grain yield. Results from both years showed that the digital video imagery identified within-field plant growth variability and that classification maps effectively differentiated grain production levels and growth conditions within the two fields. A temporal comparison of the images and classification maps indicated that plant growth patterns differed somewhat between the two successive growing seasons, though areas exhibiting consistently high or low yield were identified within each field.},

	abstract = {Sugarcane is a major crop for sugar and ethanol production and its area has increased substantially in tropical and subtropical regions in recent decades. Updated and accurate sugarcane maps are critical for monitoring sugarcane area and production and assessing its impacts on the society, economy and the environment. To date, no sugarcane mapping tools are available to generate annual maps of sugarcane at the ﬁeld scale over large regions. In this study, we developed a pixel- and phenology-based mapping tool to produce an annual map of sugarcane at 10-m spatial resolution by analyzing time-series Landsat-7/8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 images (LC/ S2/S1) during August 31, 2017 - July 1, 2019 in Guangxi province, China, which accounts for 65\% of sugarcane production of China. First, we generated annual maps of croplands and other land cover types in 2018. Second, we delineated the cropping intensity (single, double and triple cropping in a year) for all cropland pixels in 2018. Third, we identiﬁed sugarcane ﬁelds in 2018 based on its phenological characteristics. The resultant 2018 sugarcane map has producer, user and overall accuracies of 88\%, 96\% and 96\%, respectively. According to the annual sugarcane map in 2018, there was a total of 8940 km2 sugarcane in Guangxi, which was {\textasciitilde}1\% higher than the estimate from the Guangxi Agricultural Statistics Report. Finally, we identiﬁed green-up dates of those sugarcane ﬁelds in 2019, which could be used to support the sugarcane planting and management activities. Our study demonstrates the potential of the pixel- and phenology-based sugarcane mapping tool (both the algorithms and the LC/S2/S1 time series images) in identifying croplands, cropping intensity and sugarcane ﬁelds in the complex landscapes with diverse crop types, fragmented crop ﬁelds and frequent cloudy weather. The resultant annual maps from this study could be used to assist farms and sugarcane mills for sustainable sugarcane production and environment.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing studies of vegetation phenology increasingly beneﬁt from freely available satellite imagery acquired with high temporal frequency at ﬁne spatial resolution. Particularly for heterogeneous landscapes this is good news, given the drawback of medium-resolution sensors commonly used for phenology retrieval (e.g., MODIS) to properly represent the ﬁne-scale spatial variability of vegetation types. The Sentinel-2 mission acquires spectral data globally at 10 to 60 m resolution every ﬁve days. To illustrate the mission's potential for studying vegetation phenology, we retrieved phenological parameters for the Dutch barrier island Schiermonnikoog for a full season of Sentinel-2A observations in 2016. Overlapping orbits resulted in two acquisitions per 10 days, similar to what is achieved globally since the launch of Sentinel-2B. For eight locations on the island's salt marsh we compared greenness chromatic coordinate (GCC) series derived from digital repeat RGB-cameras with vegetation index series derived from Sentinel-2 (NDVI and GCC). For each series, a double hyperbolic tangent model was ﬁtted and thresholds were applied to the modelled data to estimate start-, peak-, and end-of-season (SOS/PS/EOS). Variability in Sentinel-2 derived SOS, when taken as the midpoint between minimum and peak NDVI, was well-explained by camera GCC-based SOS (R2 = 0.74, MSD = 8.0 days, RMSD = 13.0 days). However, EOS estimates from camera GCC series were on average almost two months before NDVI-based estimates. This could partially be explained by the observed exponential relationship between GCC and NDVI, as well as by the combined eﬀect of viewing angle diﬀerences and the presence of nonphotosynthetic elements in the vegetation canopy. A two-layer canopy radiative transfer model incorporating reduced chlorophyll levels in the upper layer provided a physically-based explanation of the viewing angle eﬀect. Finally, we applied the phenology retrieval approach to NDVI series for all pixels of the island in order to map spatial patterns of phenology at ﬁne resolution. Our results demonstrate the potential of the Sentinel-2 mission for providing spatially-detailed retrievals of phenology.},

Moreover, the high-priority mission candidate Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission for the Environment (CHIME) is expected to globally provide routine hyperspectral observations to support new and enhanced services for, among others, sustainable agricultural and biodiversity management. Thanks to the provision of contiguous visible-to-shortwave infrared spectral data, hyperspectral missions open enhanced opportunities for the development of new-generation retrieval models of multiple vegetation traits. Among these, canopy nitrogen content (CNC) is one of the most promising variables given its importance for agricultural monitoring applications. This work presents the first hybrid CNC retrieval model for the operational delivery from spaceborne imaging spectroscopy data. To achieve this, physically-based models were combined with machine learning regression algorithms and active learning (AL). The key concepts involve: (1) coupling the radiative transfer models PROSPECT-PRO and SAIL for the generation of a wide range of vegetation states as training data, (2) using dimensionality reduction to deal with collinearity, (3) applying an AL technique in combination with Gaussian process regression (GPR) for fine-tuning the training dataset on in field collected data, and (4) adding non-vegetated spectra to enable the model to deal with spectral heterogeneity in the image. The final CNC model was successfully validated against field data achieving a low root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.4 g/m2 and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7. The model was applied to a PRISMA image acquired over agricultural areas in the North of Munich, Germany. Mapping aboveground CNC yielded reliable estimates over the whole landscape and meaningful associated uncertainties. These promising results demon­ strate the feasibility of routinely quantifying CNC from space, such as in an operational context as part of the future CHIME mission.},

These S3 instruments will be used in combination with the imaging spectrometers on board FLEX to provide data useful for atmospheric correction of FLEX data. However, a fully synergetic approach, i.e. by exploiting the spectral and directional information from all tandem mission instruments together, is an attractive alternative which is explored in this paper. By employing all combined topof-atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance data, one can (i) characterize the relevant optical properties of the atmosphere, (ii) retrieve biophysical canopy properties including the associated reﬂectance anisotropy, and (iii) retrieve a more accurate and consistent canopy F.},

Remotely sensing optical and radar data can help to map crop types and to estimate biophysical parameters, especially with the availability of an unprecedented amount of free Sentinel data within the Copernicus programme. These datasets, whose continuity is guaranteed up to decades, offer a unique opportunity to monitor crops systematically every 5 to 10 days. Before developing operational monitoring methods, it is important to understand the temporal variations of the remote sensing signal of different crop types in a given region. In this study, we analyse the temporal trajectory of remote sensing data for a variety of winter and summer crops that are widely cultivated in the world (wheat, rapeseed, maize, soybean and sunﬂower). The test region is in southwest France, where Sentinel-1 data have been acquired since 2014. Because Sentinel-2 data were not available for this study, optical satellites similar to Sentinel-2 are used, mainly to derive NDVI, for a comparison between the temporal behaviors with radar data. The SAR backscatter and NDVI temporal proﬁles of ﬁelds with varied management practices and environmental conditions are interpreted physically. Key ﬁndings from this analysis, leading to possible applications of Sentinel-1 data, with or without the conjunction of Sentinel-2, are then described. This study points out the interest of SAR data and particularly the VH/VV ratio, which is poorly documented in previous studies.},

Climate scenarios with and without taking into account changes in the inter-annual variability of climate were developed from the output of a regional climate model for the time window 2071 to 2100. Climate change effects on the mean yield of maize and canola were consistently negative, but a positive impact was simulated for mean yield of winter wheat for elevated CO2 concentration. The coefficient of yield variation increased in the scenarios for maize and canola, but decreased for wheat. Higher thermal time requirements increased mean yield and reduced yield variability for all crops. Shifts in the sowing dates had a beneficial impact on the yield of maize, but not on the yield of canola and wheat. It is concluded that in the Alpine region, the potential effect of climate change is crop-specific. However, the introduction of new cultivars may provide means by which to maintain or even increase current productivity levels for most of the crops.},

The freely available Sentinel-2 imagery at a 10 m spatial resolution with a {\textasciitilde} 5-day repeat cycle provides an opportunity to map vegetation phenology at an unprecedented fine spatial scale. To facilitate the production of a Europe-wide Copernicus Land Monitoring Sentinel-2 based phenology dataset, we design and evaluate a framework based on a comprehensive set of ground observations, including eddy covariance gross primary production (GPP), PhenoCam green chromatic coordinate (GCC), and phenology phases from the PanEuropean Phenological database (PEP725). We test three vegetation indices (VI) — the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), and the plant phenology index (PPI) — regarding their capability to track the seasonal trajectories of GPP and GCC and their performance in reflecting spatial variabilities of the corresponding GPP and GCC phenometrics, i.e., start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS). We find that for GPP phenology, PPI performs the best, in particular for evergreen coniferous forest areas where the seasonal variations in leaf area are small and snow is prevalent during wintertime. Results are inconclusive for GCC phenology, for which no index is consistently better than the others. When comparing to PEP725 phenology phases, PPI and EVI2 perform better than NDVI regarding the spatial correlation and consistency (i.e., lower standard deviation). We also link VI phenometrics at various amplitude thresholds to the PEP725 phenophases and find that PPI SOS at 25\% and PPI EOS at 15\% provide the best matches with the ground-observed phenological stages. Finally, we demonstrate that applying bidirectional reflectance distribu­ tion function correction to Sentinel-2 reflectance is a step that can be excluded for phenology mapping in Europe.},

	abstract = {Temperature is one of the most important factors controlling the phenology of winter wheat. Rapid urbanization in China dramatically modifies the microclimate, especially temperature, surrounding cities. However, it is unclear whether such urban-induced changes in microclimate can influence the phenology of winter wheat and whether the influence is consistent across cities of different sizes. Here, we investigated the urban-induced microclimate effects on winter wheat spring phenology (i.e., the regreen-up date, RGUD) in three cities spanning a range of sizes in northern China. These three cities include Shijiazhuang (350.98 km2), Baoding (118.95 km2), and Linqing (55.12 km2), and the key data for this study are Sentinel-2 images. Based on the Sentinel-2 images, we first calculated a vegetation index (normalized difference phenology index, NDPI), and then extracted winter wheat RGUD. Finally, we analyzed the distribution of the RGUD along an urban-rural gradient using buffers surrounding the urban areas. Our study has three main results: (1) The RGUD shows a significant increasing trend along the urban-rural gradients in both Shijiazhuang and Baoding, suggesting that urban-induced increases in temperature indeed advance the spring phenology of winter wheat. (2) The maximum influence size of the urban-induced temperature effects on the RGUD is positively correlated with city size, i.e., 27 km for Shijiazhuang, 14 km for Baoding and 7 km for Linqing. (3) The change rate of the RGUD with distance along the urban-rural gradient is significantly higher in the large city (Shijiazhuang: 0.26 day/km) than it is in the middleand small-scale cities (Baoding: 0.21 day/km and Linqing: 0.11 day/km), which suggests that larger cities spread heat at a faster rate than that of smaller cities. This study suggests that the planting and management of winter wheat surrounding cities should consider the influence of city size to optimize yields.},

The effect of such changes on environmental impacts must be assessed, if the environmental goals of agriculture are also to be achieved in the future. We therefore assess the environmental impacts of adaptation scenarios previously developed with a purely economic perspective, for two case study regions in Switzerland. We use life cycle assessment at the whole-farm level, which enables the consideration of multiple environmental impact indicators, allowing us to identify potential trade-offs. We assess a simulated mixed livestock and arable crop farm representative of average farms in the two case study regions. The simulated farm is economically optimized for a reference scenario (current situation) and four future scenarios combining a climate change scenario representing a “worst case” change signal, and various price and policy scenarios. Results show that environmental impacts tend to increase in the future climate. Farms tend to extensify production, leading to a decrease in eco-eﬃciency, even more so if a decrease in agricultural product prices is assumed: socio-economic conditions may have even more inﬂuence than climate change, suggesting that there is a high potential for policy-makers to inﬂuence and mitigate the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity and the associated environmental impacts. The impacts of irrigation water use on aquatic biodiversity are revealed to be an important trade-off with farm economic optimization in the future. It is therefore recommended that aquatic biodiversity impacts be considered in assessments of agricultural adaptation to climate change. Policies directly targeting restriction of water use do not resolve this trade-off, although they do reduce impacts on aquatic biodiversity. Broader and more integrative policies are therefore required to support agricultural adaptation to the future climate while mitigating environmental impacts. In addition, different regions are found to react in a different way, suggesting that differentiated policies may be required for speciﬁc regions.},

	abstract = {Accurate, automated cloud and cloud shadow detection is a key component of the processing needed to prepare optical satellite imagery for scientiﬁc analysis. Many existing cloud detection algorithms rely on temperature information to identify clouds, making detection difﬁcult for imagers that lack a thermal band, like Sentinel-2. To get maximum beneﬁt from Sentinel-2 products it is critical to understand which algorithms best identify clouds and their shadows in images. We examined the relative performance of ﬁve different cloud-masking algorithms (Sen2Cor, MAJA, LaSRC, Fmask and Tmask) in 6 Sentinel-2 scenes (28 total images) distributed across the Eastern Hemisphere. Expanding on these comparisons, we tested ensemble approaches to improve results. We tested three ensemble approaches to cloud and shadow classiﬁcation based on the outputs of the ﬁve initial algorithms using the cloud masks in: (1) a majority prediction model; (2) a random forests model; and (3) a conditional logic model. Accuracy assessments show a trade-off between omission and commission errors in cloud detection for individual algorithms across all sites, and some algorithms are better at detecting either clouds or cloud shadows. No single algorithm outperforms the others for both clouds and shadows. Aggregating the results from multiple algorithms produces fewer undetected clouds and higher overall accuracy than any single algorithm, with as high as 2.7\% improvement over the top-performing algorithm, suggesting an ensemble approach may be the most useful for processing of Sentinel-2 data.},

Given recent advances in instrument design, radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, algorithm development, product development, validation, and delivery, the lack of standardization of reflectance terminology and products becomes a considerable source of error. This article provides full access to the basic concept and definitions of reflectance quantities, as given by Nicodemus et al. [Nicodemus, F.E., Richmond, J.C., Hsia, J.J., Ginsberg, I.W., and Limperis, T. (1977). Geometrical Considerations and Nomenclature for Reflectance. In: National Bureau of Standards, US Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. URL: http://physics.nist.gov/Divisions/Div844/facilities/specphoto/pdf/ geoConsid.pdf.] and Martonchik et al. [Martonchik, J.V., Bruegge, C.J., and Strahler, A. (2000). A review of reflectance nomenclature used in remote sensing. Remote Sensing Reviews, 19, 9–20.]. Reflectance terms such as BRDF, HDRF, BRF, BHR, DHR, black-sky albedo, white-sky albedo, and blue-sky albedo are defined, explained, and exemplified, while separating conceptual from measurable quantities. We use selected examples from the peer-reviewed literature to demonstrate that very often the current use of reflectance terminology does not fulfill physical standards and can lead to systematic errors. Secondly, the paper highlights the importance of a proper usage of definitions through quantitative comparison of different reflectance products with special emphasis on wavelength dependent effects. Reflectance quantities acquired under hemispherical illumination conditions (i.e., all outdoor measurements) depend not only on the scattering properties of the observed surface, but as well on atmospheric conditions, the object's surroundings, and the topography, with distinct expression of these effects in different wavelengths. We exemplify differences between the hemispherical and directional illumination quantities, based on observations (i.e., MISR), and on reflectance simulations of natural surfaces (i.e., vegetation canopy and snow cover). In order to improve the current situation of frequent ambiguous usage of reflectance terms and quantities, we suggest standardizing the terminology in reflectance product descriptions and that the community carefully utilizes the proposed reflectance terminology in scientific publications.},

It is distinct from uncertainty analysis, which addresses the question ‘How uncertain is the prediction?’ Uncertainty analysis needs to map what a model does when selected input assumptions and parameters are left free to vary over their range of existence, and this is equally true of a sensitivity analysis. Despite this, many uncertainty and sensitivity analyses still explore the input space moving along one-dimensional corridors leaving space of the input factors mostly unexplored. Our extensive systematic literature review shows that many highly cited papers (42\% in the present analysis) fail the elementary requirement to properly explore the space of the input factors. The results, while discipline-dependent, point to a worrying lack of standards and recognized good practices. We end by exploring possible reasons for this problem, and suggest some guidelines for proper use of the methods.},

Practitioners can in principle describe the sensitivity pattern of a model Y = f ( X1, X2, . . . , Xk) with k uncertain input factors via a full decomposition of the variance V of Y into terms depending on the factors and their interactions. More often practitioners are satisﬁed with computing just k ﬁrst order effects and k total effects, the latter describing synthetically interactions among input factors. In sensitivity analysis a key concern is the computational cost of the analysis, deﬁned in terms of number of evaluations of f ( X1, X2, . . . , Xk) needed to complete the analysis, as f ( X1, X2, . . . , Xk) is often in the form of a numerical model which may take long processing time. While the computational cost is relatively cheap and weakly dependent on k for estimating ﬁrst order effects, it remains expensive and strictly k-dependent for total effect indices.

	abstract = {The “trapezoid” or “triangle” model constitutes the most popular approach to remote sensing (RS) of surface soil moisture based on coupled thermal (i.e., land surface temperature) and optical RS observations. The model, hereinafter referred to as Thermal-Optical TRAapezoid Model (TOTRAM), is based on interpretation of the pixel distribution within the land surface temperature - vegetation index (LST-VI) space. TOTRAM suffers from two inherent limitations. It is not applicable to satellites that do not provide thermal data (e.g., Sentinel-2) and it requires parameterization for each individual observation date. To overcome these restrictions we propose a novel OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM), which is based on the linear physical relationship between soil moisture and shortwave infrared transformed reﬂectance (STR) and is parameterized based on the pixel distribution within the STR-VI space. The OPTRAM-based surface soil moisture estimates derived from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 observations for the Walnut Gulch and Little Washita watersheds were compared with ground truth soil moisture data. Results indicate that the prediction accuracies of OPTRAM and TOTRAM are comparable, with OPTRAM only requiring observations in the optical electromagnetic frequency domain. The volumetric moisture content estimation errors of both models were below 0.04 cm3 cm−3 with local calibration and about 0.04–0.05 cm3 cm−3 without calibration. We also demonstrate that OPTRAM only requires a single universal parameterization for a given location, which is a signiﬁcant advancement that opens a new avenue for remote sensing of soil moisture.},

	abstract = {Plant breeders evaluate their selection candidates in multi-environment trials to estimate their performance in contrasted environments. The number of genotype/environment combinations that can be evaluated is strongly constrained by phenotyping costs and by the necessity to limit the evaluation to a few years. Genomic prediction models taking the genotype by environment interactions (GEI) into account can help breeders identify combination of (possibly unphenotyped) genotypes and target environments optimizing the traits under selection. We propose a new prediction approach in which a secondary trait available on both the calibration and the test sets is introduced as an environment speciﬁc covariate in the prediction model (trait-assisted prediction, TAP). The originality of this approach is that the phenotyping of the test set for the secondary trait is replaced by crop-growth model (CGM) predictions. So there is no need to sow and phenotype the test set in each environment which is a clear advantage over the classical traitassisted prediction models. The interest of this approach, called CGM-TAP, is highest if the secondary trait is easy to predict with CGM and strongly related to the target trait in each environment (and thus capturing GEI). We tested CGM-TAP on bread wheat with heading date as secondary trait and grain yield as target trait. Simple CGMTAP model with a linear effect of heading date resulted in high predictive abilities in three prediction scenarios (sparse testing, or prediction of new genotypes or of new environments). It increased predictive abilities of all reference GEI models, even those involving sophisticated environmental covariates.},

	abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) estimates can inform decision-making in crop management. The European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite, with observations in the red-edge spectral region, can monitor crops globally at sub-ﬁeld spatial resolutions (10–20 m). However, satellite LAI estimates require calibration with ground measurements. Calibration is challenged by spatial heterogeneity and scale mismatches between ﬁeld and satellite measurements. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), generating high-resolution (cm-scale) LAI estimates, provide intermediary observations that we use here to characterise uncertainty and reduce spatial scaling discrepancies between Sentinel-2 observations and ﬁeld surveys. We use a novel UAV multispectral sensor that matches Sentinel-2 spectral bands, ﬂown in conjunction with LAI ground measurements. UAV and ﬁeld surveys were conducted on multiple dates—coinciding with diﬀerent wheat growth stages—that corresponded to Sentinel-2 overpasses. We compared chlorophyll red-edge index (CIred-edge) maps, derived from the Sentinel-2 and UAV platforms. We used Gaussian processes regression machine learning to calibrate a UAV model for LAI, based on ground data. Using the UAV LAI, we evaluated a two-stage calibration approach for generating robust LAI estimates from Sentinel-2. The agreement between Sentinel-2 and UAV CIred-edge values increased with growth stage—R2 ranged from 0.32 (stem elongation) to 0.75 (milk development). The CIred-edge variance between the two platforms was more comparable later in the growing season due to a more homogeneous and closed wheat canopy. The single-stage Sentinel-2 LAI calibration (i.e., direct calibration from ground measurements) performed poorly (mean R2 = 0.29, mean NRMSE = 17\%) when compared to the two-stage calibration using the UAV data (mean R2 = 0.88, mean NRMSE = 8\%). The two-stage approach reduced both errors and biases by {\textgreater}50\%. By upscaling ground measurements and providing more representative model training samples, UAV observations provide an eﬀective and viable means of enhancing Sentinel-2 wheat LAI retrievals. We anticipate that our UAV calibration approach to resolving spatial heterogeneity would enhance the retrieval accuracy of LAI and additional biophysical variables for other arable crop types and a broader range of vegetation cover types.},

	abstract = {For the last decade, Gaussian process regression (GPR) proved to be a competitive machine learning regression algorithm for Earth observation applications, with attractive unique properties such as band relevance ranking and uncertainty estimates. More recently, GPR also proved to be a proﬁcient time series processor to ﬁll up gaps in optical imagery, typically due to cloud cover. This makes GPR perfectly suited for large-scale spatiotemporal processing of satellite imageries into cloud-free products of biophysical variables. With the advent of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, new opportunities emerged to process local-to-planetary scale satellite data using advanced machine learning techniques and convert them into gap-ﬁlled vegetation properties products. However, GPR is not yet part of the GEE ecosystem. To circumvent this limitation, this work proposes a general adaptation of GPR formulation to parallel processing framework and its integration into GEE. To demonstrate the functioning and utility of the developed workﬂow, a GPR model predicting green leaf area index (LAIG) from Sentinel-2 imagery was imported. Although by running this GPR model into GEE any corner of the world can be mapped into LAIG at a resolution of 20 m, here we show some demonstration cases over western Europe with zoom-ins over Spain. Thanks to the computational power of GEE, the mapping takes place on-the-ﬂy. Additionally, a GPR-based gap ﬁlling strategy based on pre-optimized kernel hyperparameters is also put forward for the generation of multi-orbit cloud-free LAIG maps with an unprecedented level of detail, and the extraction of regularly-sampled LAIG time series at a pixel level. The ability to plugin a locallytrained GPR model into the GEE framework and its instant processing opens up a new paradigm of remote sensing image processing.},

Remote sensing-based indices such as normalized diﬀerence vegetative index (NDVI) are sensitive to biomass and nitrogen (N) variability in crop canopies.

This study was conducted in northeastern Colorado in 2010 and 2011. The NDVI readings were acquired weekly from March to June, during 2010 and 2011. The correlation between NDVI and grain yield was determined using Pearson’s product-moment correlation coeﬃcient (r). The k-means clustering method was used to classify mean NDVI and mean grain yield into three classes. The overall accuracy between NDVI and yield classes was reported. The ﬁndings of this study show that, under dryland conditions, there is a reliable correlation between grain yield and NDVI at the early growing season, at the anthesis growth stage, and the mid-grain ﬁlling growth stage, as well as a poor association under irrigated conditions. Our results suggest that when the sensor is not saturated, i.e., NDVI {\textless} 0.9, NDVI could assess grain yield with fair accuracy. This study demonstrated the potential of using NDVI readings as a tool to diﬀerentiate and identify superior wheat genotypes.},

The objective of this study is to respecify PTQ to enhance the explanatory power of statistical models used to explain grains per square meter (GM−2), and increase understanding of weather’s impact on yields. The primary objective is to identify and quantify potential gains from including separate components of solar radiation (Solar) and temperature (Temp) in place of PTQ (Solar/Temp) to improve wheat yield model explanatory ability. The study also determines the optimal time interval that defines PTQ by varying the number of days before and after 50\% anthesis. Using wheat test plot data from Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maíz y Trigo (CIMMYT) in Mexico’s Yaqui Valley, a multivariate regressionbased stochastic model of wheat yields was used to estimate the impact of altering PTQ definition and specification. Results support previous research: the maximum F-test value of 66.02 and adjusted R2 value of 0.446 were obtained for 31 d before to 1 d after 50\% anthesis. Interpretation and analysis were also enhanced by disaggregating PTQ into separate variables Solar and Temp. A 1 MJ m−2 d−1 increase in Solar increased GM−2 by 1.25\%, whereas a 1°C increase in Temp decreased GM−2 by 2.8\%. This difference in yield responsiveness to weather components results in greater statistical significance, explanatory power, and interpretation of GM−2 models. Future research that builds on these results will better explain, predict, and forecast crop yields.},

	abstract = {The frequent acquisitions of fine spatial resolution imagery (10 m) offered by recent multispectral satellite missions, including Sentinel-2, can resolve single agricultural fields and thus provide crop-specific phenology metrics, a crucial information for crop monitoring. However, effective phenology retrieval may still be hampered by significant cloud cover. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations are not restricted by weather conditions, and Sentinel-1 thus ensures more frequent observations of the land surface. However, these data have not been systematically exploited for phenology retrieval so far. In this study, we extracted crop-specific land surface phenology (LSP) from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 of major European crops (common and durum wheat, barley, maize, oats, rape and turnip rape, sugar beet, sunflower, and dry pulses) using ground-truth information from the “Copernicus module” of the Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS) of 2018. We consistently used a single model-fit approach to retrieve LSP metrics on temporal profiles of CR (Cross Ratio, the ratio of the backscattering coefficient VH/VV from Sentinel-1) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from Sentinel-2). Our analysis revealed that LSP retrievals from Sentinel-1 are comparable to those of Sentinel-2, particularly for winter crops. The start of season (SOS) timings, as derived from Sentinel-1 and -2, are signifi­ cantly correlated (average r of 0.78 for winter and 0.46 for summer crops). The correlation is lower for end of season retrievals (EOS, r of 0.62 and 0.34). Agreement between LSP derived from Sentinel-1 and -2 varies among crop types, ranging from r = 0.89 and mean absolute error MAE = 10 days (SOS of dry pulses) to r = 0.15 and MAE = 53 days (EOS of sugar beet). Observed deviations revealed that Sentinel-1 and -2 LSP retrievals can be complementary; for example for winter crops we found that SAR detected the start of the spring growth while multispectral data is sensitive to the vegetative growth before and during winter. To test if our results correspond reasonably to in-situ data, we compared average crop-specific LSP for Germany to average phenology from ground phenological observations of 2018 gathered from the German Meteorological Service (DWD). Our study demonstrated that both Sentinel-1 and -2 can provide relevant and at times complementary LSP information at field- and crop-level.},

	abstract = {Heat units, expressed in growing degree-days (GDD), are frequently used to describe the timing of biological processes. The basic equation used is GDD = [(TMAx + TM,,)/21 - TBASE,where TM, and TMIN are daily maximum and minimum air temperature, respectively, and TBAsE is the base temperature. Two methods of interpreting this equation for calculating GDD are: (1) if the daily mean temperature is less than the base, it is set equal to the base temperature, or (2) if TMAx or T MIN{\textless} TaAsE they are reset equal to TBASE. The objective of this paper is to show the differences which can result from using these two methods to estimate GDD, and make researchers and practitioners aware of the need to report clearly which method was used in the calculations. Although percent difference between methods of calculation are dependent on TMAx and Thlw data used to compute GDD, our comparisons have produced differences up to 83\% when using a 0°C base for wheat (Triticum aestiuum L.). Greater differences were found for corn (Zea muys L.) when using a base temperature of 10°C. Differences between the methods occur if only TMIN is less than TBASE,and then Method 1 accumulates fewer GDD than Method 2. When incorporating an upper threshold, as commonly done with corn, there was a greater difference between the two methods. Not recognizing the discrepancy between methods can result in confusion and add error in quantifying relationships between heat unit accumulation and timing of events in crop development and growth, particularly in crop simulation models. Thi:s paper demonstrates the need for authors to clearly communicate the method of calculating GDD so others can correctly interpret and apply reported results. 0 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a time-weighted version of the dynamic time warping (DTW) method for land-use and land-cover classiﬁcation using remote sensing image time series. Methods based on DTW have achieved signiﬁcant results in time-series data mining. The original DTW method works well for shape matching, but is not suited for remote sensing time-series classiﬁcation. It disregards the temporal range when ﬁnding the best alignment between two time series. Since each land-cover class has a speciﬁc phenological cycle, a good time-series land-cover classiﬁer needs to balance between shape matching and temporal alignment. To that end, we adjusted the original DTW method to include a temporal weight that accounts for seasonality of land-cover types. The resulting algorithm improves on previous methods for land-cover classiﬁcation using DTW. In a case study in a tropical forest area, our proposed logistic time-weighted version achieves the best overall accuracy of 87.32\%. The accuracy of a version with maximum time delay constraints is 84.66\%. A time-warping method without time constraints has a 70.14\% accuracy. To get good results with the proposed algorithm, the spatial and temporal resolutions of the data should capture the properties of the landscape. The pattern samples should also represent well the temporal variation of land cover.},

	abstract = {Models of soil reflectance under changing moisture conditions are needed to better quantify soil and vegetation properties from remote sensing. In this study, measurements of reflected shortwave radiation (400–2500 nm) were acquired in a laboratory setting for four different soils at various moisture contents. The observed changes in soil reflectance revealed a nonlinear dependence on moisture that was well described by an exponential model, and was similar for different soil types when moisture was expressed as degree of saturation. Reflectance saturated at much lower moisture contents in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectral region than in the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) spectral region, suggesting that longer wavelengths are better suited for measuring volumetric moisture contents above ෂ20\%. To explore the potential of a general reflectance model based solely on dry reflectance and moisture, we employed a Monte Carlo analysis that accounted for observed variability in the measured spectra. Modeling results indicated that the SWIR region offers significant potential for relating moisture and reflectance on an operational basis, with uncertainties less than half as large as in the VNIR. The results of this study help to quantify the strong influence of moisture on spectral reflectance and absorption features, and should aid in the development of operational algorithms as well as more physically based models in the future.},

	abstract = {Imaging spectroscopy provides the opportunity to monitor nutrient status of vegetation. In crops, prior studies have generally been limited in scope, either to a small wavelength range (e.g., 400–1300 nm), a small number of crop cultivars, a single growth stage or single growing season. Methods that are not time- or site-specific are needed to use imaging spectroscopy for routine monitoring of crop status. Using data from four cultivars of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), three growth stages and two growing seasons, we demonstrate the capacity of full-range (400–2350 nm) imaging spectroscopy to quantify nutrient status (petiole nitrate, whole leaf and vine total nitrogen) and predict tuber yield in potatoes across cultivars, growth stages and growing seasons. We specifically tested the capabilities of: (1) ordinary least-squares regression (OLSR) using traditional hyperspectral vegetation indices (VIs); (2) partial least-squares regression (PLSR) using full spectrum (400–2350 nm), VNIR(visible-to-near infrared: 400–1300 nm) or SWIR-only (shortwave infrared: 1400–2350 nm) wavelengths; (3) predictive models developed for one potato type or planting season on withheld data from a different type or season. Our results show that OLSR models produced poor predictions with data from all dates pooled together (validation R2 {\textless} 0.01). Single-date OLSR models performed better (R2 = 0.20–0.60, relative RMSE = 15–30\%). PLSR models performed well and were comparable using different spectral regions (full-spectrum, VNIR-only and SWIR-only), with validation R2 = 0.68–0.82 and RRMSE = 12–25\%. Testing across potato types, models pro­ duced reliable predictions (R2 = 0.45–0.75, RRMSE = 13–30\%), but with some bias. Cross-season models had validation R2 = 0.46–0.75 and RRMSE = 17–100\%, with a more significant bias than the cross-potato type models. To achieve models that are generalizable and robust, we recommend: (1) obtaining ground measure­ ments that capture the full range of plant growth conditions and developmental stages, and (2) ensuring that image processing approaches minimize spectral discrepancies among dates.},

	abstract = {Cropping intensity has undergone dramatic changes worldwide due to the eﬀects of climate changes and human management activities. Cropping intensity is an important factor contributing to crop production and food security at local, regional and national scales, and is a critical input data variable for many global climate, land surface, and crop models. To generate annual cropping intensity maps at large scales, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images at 500-m or 250-m spatial resolution have problems with mixed land cover types within a pixel (mixed pixel), and Landsat images at 30-m spatial resolution suﬀer from low temporal resolution (16-day). To overcome these limitations, we developed a straightforward and eﬃcient pixeland phenology-based algorithm to generate annual cropping intensity maps over large spatial domains at high spatial resolution by integrating Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 time series image data for 2016–2018 using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. In this pilot study, we report annual cropping intensity maps for 2017 at 30-m spatial resolution over seven study areas selected according to agro-climatic zones in China. Based on ﬁeld-scale sample data, the annual cropping intensity maps for the study areas had overall accuracy rates of 89–99\%, with Kappa coeﬃcients of 0.76–0.91. The overall accuracy of the annual cropping intensity maps was 93\%, with a Kappa coeﬃcient of 0.84. These cropping intensity maps can also be used to enable identiﬁcation of various crop types from phenological information extracted from the growth cycle of each crop. These algorithms can be readily applied to other regions in China to generate annual cropping intensity maps and quantify inter-annual cropping intensity variations at the national scale with a greatly improved accuracy.},

	abstract = {Heteroscedastic regression considering the varying noises among observations has many applications in the ﬁelds like machine learning and statistics. Here we focus on the heteroscedastic Gaussian process (HGP) regression which integrates the latent function and the noise function together in a uniﬁed non-parametric Bayesian framework. Though showing remarkable performance, HGP suffers from the cubic time complexity, which strictly limits its application to big data. To improve the scalability, we ﬁrst develop a variational sparse inference algorithm, named VSHGP, to handle large-scale datasets. Furthermore, two variants are developed to improve the scalability and capability of VSHGP. The ﬁrst is stochastic VSHGP (SVSHGP) which derives a factorized evidence lower bound, thus enhancing efﬁcient stochastic variational inference. The second is distributed VSHGP (DVSHGP) which (i) follows the Bayesian committee machine formalism to distribute computations over multiple local VSHGP experts with many inducing points; and (ii) adopts hybrid parameters for experts to guard against over-ﬁtting and capture local variety. The superiority of DVSHGP and SVSHGP as compared to existing scalable heteroscedastic/homoscedastic GPs is then extensively veriﬁed on various datasets.},

	abstract = {Time series of remote sensing imagery or derived vegetation indices and biophysical products have been shown particularly useful to characterize land ecosystem dynamics. Various methods have been developed based on temporal trajectory analysis to characterize, classify and detect changes in ecosystem dynamics. Although time series similarity measures play an important role in these methods, a quantitative comparison of the similarity measures is lacking. The objective of this study was to provide an overview and quantitative comparison of the similarity measures in function of varying time series and ecosystem characteristics, such as amplitude, timing and noise effects. For this purpose, the performance was evaluated for the commonly used similarity measures (D), ranging from Manhattan (DMan), Euclidean (DE) and Mahalanobis (DMah) distance measures, to correlation (DCC), Principal Component Analysis (PCA; DPCA) and Fourier based (DFFT,Dξ, DFk) similarities. The quantitative comparison consists of a series of Monte-Carlo simulations based on subsets of global MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data. Results of the simulations reveal four main groups of time series similarity measures with different sensitivities: (i) DMan, DE, DPCA, DFk quantify the difference in time series values, (ii) DMah accounts for temporal correlation and non-stationarity of variance, (iii) DCC measures the temporal correlation, and (iv) the Fourier based DFFT and Dξ show their speciﬁc sensitivity based on the selected Fourier components. The difference measures show relatively the highest sensitivity to amplitude effects, whereas the correlation based measures are highly sensitive to variations in timing and noise. The Fourier based measures, ﬁnally, depend highly on the signal to noise ratio and the balance between amplitude and phase dominance. The heterogeneity in sensitivity of each D stresses the importance of (i) understanding the time series characteristics before applying any classiﬁcation of change detection approach and (ii) deﬁning the variability one wants to identify/account for. This requires an understanding of the ecosystem dynamics and time series characteristics related to the baseline, amplitude, timing, noise and variability of the ecosystem time series. This is also illustrated in the quantitative comparison, where the different sensitivities of D for the NDVI, EVI, and LAI data relate speciﬁcally to the temporal characteristics of each data set. Additionally, the effect of noise and intra- and interclass variability is demonstrated in a case study based on land cover classiﬁcation.},

Leaf chlorophyll content helps in interpreting the chlorophyll ﬂuorescence signal from space, whereas oceanic chlorophyll concentration allows us to quantify the healthiness of the oceans. Recently, the family of Bayesian nonparametric methods has provided excellent results in these situations. A particularly useful method in this framework is the Gaussian process regression (GPR). However, standard GPR assumes that the variance of the noise process is independent of the signal, which does not hold in most of the problems. In this letter, we propose a nonstandard variational approximation that allows accurate inference in signal-dependent noise scenarios. We show that the so-called variational heteroscedastic GPR (VHGPR) is an excellent alternative to standard GPR in two relevant Earth observation examples, namely, Chl vegetation retrieval from hyperspectral images and oceanic Chl concentration estimation from in situ measured reﬂectances. The proposed VHGPR outperforms the tested empirical approaches, as well as statistical linear regression (both least squares and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), neural nets, and kernel ridge regression, and the homoscedastic GPR, in terms of accuracy and bias, and proves more robust when a low number of examples is available.},

We evaluated the utility of a selection of 40 VIs to derive Leaf Area Index (LAI), fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) and fraction of vegetation Cover (fCover) of winter wheat crop using regression method. We calibrated models for specific winter wheat development stages and compared the predictions with all-season models. The most useful VIs could be grouped into several types: (1) indices which use green and NIR band, (2) indices based on red edge bands, (3) indices which use red and NIR band and (4) the MCARI/OSAVIre index. It was found that fAPAR and fCover could be predicted with good accuracy using all-season models (rRMSE of 14\% and 23\% respectively), while LAI showed lower accuracy (rRMSE = 45\%). The LAI model calibrated over the tillering stage was recommended for usage in the early stages of crop development. Compared with the existing methods for biophysical variables retrieval from Sentinel-2 data (i.e. the Level2B processor in SNAP) the regression approach based on VIs showed to be a viable alternative.},

	abstract = {Using a spectral vegetation index (VI) is an efﬁcient approach for monitoring plant phenology from remotelysensed data. However, the quantitative biophysical meaning of most VIs is still unclear, and, particularly at high northern latitudes characterized by low green biomass renewal rate and snow-affected VI signals, it is difﬁcult to use them for tracking seasonal vegetation growth and retrieving phenology. In this study we propose a physically-based new vegetation index for characterizing terrestrial vegetation canopy green leaf area dynamics: the plant phenology index (PPI). PPI is derived from the solution to a radiative transfer equation, is computed from red and near-infrared (NIR) reﬂectance, and has a nearly linear relationship with canopy green leaf area index (LAI), enabling it to depict canopy foliage density well. This capability is veriﬁed with stacked-leaf measurements, canopy reﬂectance model simulations, and ﬁeld LAI measurements from international sites. Snow inﬂuence on PPI is shown by modeling and satellite observations to be less severe than on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), while soil brightness variations in general have moderate inﬂuence on PPI. Comparison of satellite-derived PPI to ground observations of plant phenology and gross primary productivity (GPP) shows strong similarity of temporal patterns over several Nordic boreal forest sites. The proposed PPI can thus serve as an efﬁcient tool for estimating plant canopy growth, and will enable improved vegetation monitoring, particularly of evergreen needle-leaf forest phenology at high northern latitudes.},

	abstract = {Dynamic time warping (DTW), which ﬁnds the minimum path by providing non-linear alignments between two time series, has been widely used as a distance measure for time series classiﬁcation and clustering. However, DTW does not account for the relative importance regarding the phase difference between a reference point and a testing point. This may lead to misclassiﬁcation especially in applications where the shape similarity between two sequences is a major consideration for an accurate recognition. Therefore, we propose a novel distance measure, called a weighted DTW (WDTW), which is a penaltybased DTW. Our approach penalizes points with higher phase difference between a reference point and a testing point in order to prevent minimum distance distortion caused by outliers. The rationale underlying the proposed distance measure is demonstrated with some illustrative examples. A new weight function, called the modiﬁed logistic weight function (MLWF), is also proposed to systematically assign weights as a function of the phase difference between a reference point and a testing point. By applying different weights to adjacent points, the proposed algorithm can enhance the detection of similarity between two time series. We show that some popular distance measures such as DTW and Euclidean distance are special cases of our proposed WDTW measure. We extend the proposed idea to other variants of DTW such as derivative dynamic time warping (DDTW) and propose the weighted version of DDTW. We have compared the performances of our proposed procedures with other popular approaches using public data sets available through the UCR Time Series Data Mining Archive for both time series classiﬁcation and clustering problems. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approaches can achieve improved accuracy for time series classiﬁcation and clustering problems.},

	abstract = {We introduce a novel method for classiﬁcation and mapping of landform elements from a DEM based on the principle of pattern recognition rather than differential geometry. At the core of the method is the concept of geomorphon (geomorphologic phonotypes) — a simple ternary pattern that serves as an archetype of a particular terrain morphology. A ﬁnite number of 498 geomorphons constitute a comprehensive and exhaustive set of all possible morphological terrain types including standard elements of landscape, as well as unfamiliar forms rarely found in natural terrestrial surfaces. A single scan of a DEM assigns an appropriate geomorphon to every cell in the raster using a procedure that self-adapts to identify the most suitable spatial scale at each location. As a result, the method classiﬁes landform elements at a range of different spatial scales with unprecedented computational efﬁciency. A general purpose geomorphometric map — an interpreted map of topography — is obtained by generalizing allgeomorphons to a small number of the most common landform elements. Due to the robustness and high computational efﬁciency of the method high resolution geomorphometric maps having continental and even global extents can be generated from giga-cell DEMs. Such maps are a valuable new resource for both manual and automated geomorphometric analyses. In order to demonstrate a practical application of this new method, a 30 m cell−1 geomorphometric map of the entire country of Poland is generated and the features and potential usage of this map are brieﬂy discussed. The computer implementation of the method is outlined. The code is available in the public domain.},

The largest wheat producers include the European Union, China, India, Russia, United States, Canada, Pakistan, Australia, Ukraine and Argentina. Cultivation of wheat across such diverse global environments with variation in climate, biotic and abiotic stresses, requires cultivars adapted to a range of growing conditions. One intrinsic way that wheat achieves adaptation is through variation in phenology (seasonal timing of the lifecycle) and related traits (e.g., those affecting plant architecture). It is important to understand the genes that underlie this variation, and how they interact with each other, other traits and the growing environment. This review summarises the current understanding of phenology and developmental traits that adapt wheat to different environments. Examples are provided to illustrate how different combinations of alleles can facilitate breeding of wheat varieties with optimal crop performance for different growing regions or farming systems.},

This study analyses genotypes × environments interaction (G × E), genetic progress, and grain yield stability under contrasting production systems. For this, we analyzed datasets obtained from three Swiss trial-networks of winter wheat that were designed to evaluate genotypes under organic farming conditions, conventional management with low-inputs (150 kg nitrogen (N) ha−1 with no fungicide application) and conventional management with high-inputs (170 kg N ha−1 with fungicide application). The datasets covered the periods from 1998 to 2018 for organic and conventional management with low-inputs and from 2008 to 2018 for conventional management with high-inputs. The trial-networks evaluated each year an average of 36 winter wheat genotypes that included released varieties, advanced breeding lines, and lines for registration and post-registration in Switzerland. We investigated within each trial-network the inﬂuence of years, genotypes, environments and their interactions on the total variance in grain yield and grain N concentration using variance components analyses. We further applied mixed models with regression features to dissect genetic components due to breeding efforts from non-genetic components. The genotype as a single factor or as a factor interacting with the environment or the year (G × E, G × year, and G × E × year) explained 13\% (organic), 20\% (conventional low-inputs), and 24\% (conventional high-inputs) of the variance in grain yield, while the corresponding values for grain N concentration were 29\%, 25\%, and 32\%. Grain yield has stagnated since 1990 for conventional systems while the trend under organic management was slightly negative. The dissection of a genetic component from the grain yield trends under conventional management showed that genetic improvements contributed with 0.58 and 0.68 t ha−1 y−1 with low- and high- inputs, respectively. In contrast, a signiﬁcant genetic source in the grain yield trend under organic management was not detected. Therefore, breeding efforts have been less effective on the wheat productivity for organic farming conditions than for conventional ones.},

	abstract = {Land surface phenology (LSP) provides bio-indication of ongoing climate change. It uses space-borne greenness proxies to monitor plant phenology at the landscape level from the regional to global scale. However, several unconsidered methodological and observational -related limitations may lead to misinterpretation of the satellitederived signals. For instance, changes in species composition within a pixel could result in a change in the time series of the greenness proxy, due to the distinct phenology of the plant species involved. The change in the signal would then be misinterpreted as a phenological change while it is actually related to changes in species composition within the pixel. Other limitations include the selection of the smoothing technique and the method used to extract the LSP metrics. These not only may affect the timing of the LSP metrics but also the sign of the observed LSP change. Another and much less known limitation is related to the mixed signal from multi-canopy layers. Satellites may detect changes that corresponds to the understorey layer in complex vertical vegetation systems while the ‘real’ contribution of this layer (in terms of ecosystem functioning and dynamics) might be small compared to the undetected overstorey layer in cases of a late overstorey development. Here, some of the LSP basics are reviewed with emphasis on these (and other) potential sources of misinterpretation. Several aids to overcome these limitations, which include suggestions for multi methods analysis and the integration of information from satellite and ground-based sensors are provided alongside some prospective future LSP research directions. © 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The ability to regionally monitor crop progress and condition through the growing season beneﬁts both crop management and yield estimation. In the United States, these metrics are reported weekly at state or district (multiple counties) levels by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) using ﬁeld observations provided by trained local reporters. However, the ground data collection process supporting this effort is time consuming and subjective. Furthermore, operational crop management and yield estimation efforts require information with more granularity than at the state or district level. This paper evaluates remote sensing approaches for mapping crop phenology using vegetation index time-series generated by fusing Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface reﬂectance imagery to improve temporal sampling over that provided by Landsat alone. The case study focuses on an agricultural region in central Iowa from 2001 to 2014. Our objectives are 1) to assess Landsat-MODIS data fusion results over cropland; 2) to map crop phenology at 30 m resolution using fused surface reﬂectance data; and 3) to identify the relationships between remotely sensed crop phenology metrics and the crop progress stages reported by NASS. The results show that detailed spatial and temporal variability in vegetation development across this landscape can be identiﬁed using the fused Landsat-MODIS data. The mean difference (bias) in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between actual Landsat observations and the fused Landsat-MODIS data, generated for Landsat overpass dates, is in the range of −0.011 to 0.028 for every year. The derived phenological metrics show distinct features for different crops and natural vegetation at ﬁeld scales. Strong correlations are observed between remotely sensed phenological stages, based on NDVI curve inﬂection points, and the observed crop physiological growth stages from the NASS Crop Progress (CP) reports. The green-up dates detected from remote sensing data typically occurred during crop vegetative stages when 2–4 leaves were developed for both corn and soybeans, or about 1–3 weeks after the reported emergence dates when the plant were ﬁrst visible to groundbased observers. Despite being a lagging indicator, remotely sensed green-up can be used effectively to backcast emergence, e.g. as input to spatially distributed crop models. The differences in green-up date between corn and soybean were 8–10 days, consistent with the offset in emergence dates reported by NASS at district level. The reported harvest dates were typically about 2–3 weeks after the dormancy stage was detected via remote sensing for corn and about 1–2 weeks for soybeans. This suggests that probable harvest times for individual ﬁelds may be predicted 1–3 weeks ahead using remote sensing data. The results suggest that crop phenology and certain growth stages at ﬁeld scales (30 m spatial resolution) can be linked and mapped by integrating imagery from multiple remote sensing platforms.},

	abstract = {Retrieval of vegetation properties from satellite and airborne optical data usually takes place after atmospheric correction, yet it is also possible to develop retrieval algorithms directly from top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance data. One of the key vegetation variables that can be retrieved from at-sensor TOA radiance data is leaf area index (LAI) if algorithms account for variability in atmosphere. We demonstrate the feasibility of LAI retrieval from Sentinel-2 (S2) TOA radiance data (L1C product) in a hybrid machine learning framework. To achieve this, the coupled leaf-canopy-atmosphere radiative transfer models PROSAIL-6SV were used to simulate a look-up table (LUT) of TOA radiance data and associated input variables. This LUT was then used to train the Bayesian machine learning algorithms Gaussian processes regression (GPR) and variational heteroscedastic GPR (VHGPR). PROSAIL simulations were also used to train GPR and VHGPR models for LAI retrieval from S2 images at bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) level (L2A product) for comparison purposes. The BOA and TOA LAI products were consistently validated against a field dataset with GPR (R2 of 0.78) and with VHGPR (R2 of 0.80) and for both cases a slightly lower RMSE for the TOA LAI product (about 10\% reduction). Because of delivering superior accuracies and lower uncertainties, the VHGPR models were further applied for LAI mapping using S2 acquisitions over the agricultural sites Marchfeld (Austria) and Barrax (Spain). The models led to consistent LAI maps at BOA and TOA scale. The LAI maps were also compared against LAI maps as generated by the SNAP toolbox, which is based on a neural network (NN). Maps were again consistent, however the SNAP NN model tends to overestimate over dense vegetation cover. Overall, this study demonstrated that hybrid LAI retrieval algorithms can be developed from TOA radiance data given a cloud-free sky, thus without the need of atmospheric correction. To the benefit of the community, the development of such hybrid models for the retrieval vegetation properties from BOA or TOA images has been streamlined in the freely downloadable ALG-ARTMO software framework.},

Univariate measurements of spatial autocorrelation such as Moran’s I and Geary’s c are widely used, but extensions to the multivariate case (i.e. multi-species) are rare. Here, we propose a multivariate spatial analysis based on Moran’s I (MULTISPATI) by introducing a row-sum standardized spatial weight matrix in the statistical triplet notation. This analysis, which is a generalization of Wartenberg’s approach to multivariate spatial correlation, would imply a compromise between the relations among many variables (multivariate analysis) and their spatial structure (autocorrelation). MULTISPATI approach is very flexible and can handle various kinds of data (quantitative and/or qualitative data, contingency tables).},

In particular, we propose three different active learning strategies, developed for kernel ridge regression (KRR). The ﬁrst strategy uses a pool of regressors in order to select the samples with the greater disagreements between the different regressors, while the second one relies on the idea to add samples that are distant from the available training samples, and the last strategy is based on the selection of samples which exhibit a high expected prediction error. A thorough experimental study is presented. It is based on ten different wind speed measurement stations distributed over the vast Algerian territory.

	abstract = {The phenological dynamics of crops reﬂect the response and feedback of agricultural systems to climate and environmental constraints, and have signiﬁcant controls on carbon and nutrient cycling across the globe. Remote monitoring of crop phenological dynamics in a consistent and systematic manner is vitally crucial for optimizing the farm management activities and evaluating the agricultural resilience to extreme weather conditions and future climate change. Yet our ability to retrieve crop growing stages with satellite time series is limited. The remotely sensed phenological transition dates may not be characteristic of crop physiological growing stages. The objective of this study is to develop a remote sensing phenological monitoring framework that can reconcile satellite-based phenological measures with ground-based crop growing observations, with corn and soybean in Illinois as a case study. The framework comprises three key components: time series phenological pre-processing, time series phenological modeling, and time series phenological characterization. As an exploratory prototype, the framework retrieved a total of 56 phenological transition dates that were subsequently evaluated with the district-level ground phenological observations. The results indicated that the devised framework can adequately retrieve a wide range of physiological growing stages for corn and soybean in Illinois, with R square greater than 0.6 and RMSE less than 1 week for most stages. The devised framework largely extends the limited satellite phenological measures to a range of phenological transition dates that are characteristic of essential crop growing stages. It paves the way for formulating standard crop phenological monitoring protocols via remote sensing. The wealth of retrieved phenological characteristics open up unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying the crop growth in response to varying environmental stresses, and to make more adaptive farm management strategies towards sustained agricultural development.},

	abstract = {A novel methodology is proposed to robustly map oil seed rape (OSR) ﬂowering phenology from time series generated from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) sensors. The time series are averaged at parcel level, initially for a set of 229 reference parcels for which multiple phenological observations on OSR ﬂowering have been collected from April 21 to May 19, 2018. The set of OSR parcels is extended to a regional sample of 32,355 OSR parcels derived from a regional S2 classiﬁcation. The study area comprises the northern Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (N) and the southern Bavaria (S) regions in Germany. A method was developed to automatically compute peak ﬂowering at parcel level from the S2 time signature of the Normalized Diﬀerence Yellow Index (NDYI) and from the local minimum in S1 VV polarized backscattering coeﬃcients. Peak ﬂowering was determined at a temporal accuracy of 1 to 4 days. A systematic ﬂowering delay of 1 day was observed in the S1 detection compared to S2. Peak ﬂowering diﬀered by 12 days between the N and S. Considerable local variation was observed in the N-S parcel-level ﬂowering gradient. Additional in-situ phenology observations at 70 Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) stations conﬁrm the spatial and temporal consistency between S1 and S2 signatures and ﬂowering phenology across both regions. Conditions during ﬂowering strongly determine OSR yield, therefore, the capacity to continuously characterize spatially the timing of key ﬂowering dates across large areas is key. To illustrate this, expected ﬂowering dates were simulated assuming a single OSR variety with a 425 growing degree days (GDD) requirement to reach ﬂowering. This GDD requirement was calculated based on parcel-level peak ﬂowering dates and temperatures accumulated from 25-km gridded meteorological data. The correlation between simulated and S2 observed peak ﬂowering dates still equaled 0.84 and 0.54 for the N and S respectively. These Sentinel-based parcel-level ﬂowering parameters can be combined with weather data to support in-season predictions of OSR yield, area, and production. Our approach identiﬁed the unique temporal signatures of S1 and S2 associated with OSR ﬂowering and can now be applied to monitor OSR phenology for parcels across the globe.},

Several soil and terrain variables are used to classify the ﬁeld points into classes. Fuzzy k-means cluster analysis is a widely used tool to delineate management classes in the multivariate context. However, this clustering method does not consider the presence of spatial correlations in the data. The MULTISPATI-PCA algorithm is an extension of principal component analysis that considers spatial autocorrelation in the original variables to produce synthetic variables. We propose and illustrate the implementation of a new method (KM-sPC) for subﬁeld management class delineation based on the joint use of MULTISPATI-PCA and fuzzy k-means cluster. To assess the performance of KM-sPC, we performed clustering of the original soil variables and of both spatial and classical principal components on three ﬁeld data sets. KM-sPC algorithm improved the non-spatial clustering in the formation of within-ﬁeld management classes. Mapping of KM-sPC classiﬁcation shows a more contiguous zoning. KM-sPC showed the highest yield differences between delineated classes and the smallest within-class yield variance.},

	abstract = {The short revisit times afforded by recently-deployed optical satellite sensors that acquire 3–30 m resolution imagery provide new opportunities to study seasonal vegetation dynamics. Previous studies demonstrated a successful retrieval of phenology with Sentinel-2 for relatively stable annual growing seasons. In semi-arid East Africa however, vegetation responds rapidly to a concentration of rainfall over short periods and consequently is subject to strong interannual variability. Obtaining a sufficient density of cloud-free acquisitions to accurately describe these short vegetation cycles is therefore challenging. The objective of this study is to evaluate if data from two satellite constellations, i.e., PlanetScope (3 m resolution) and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution), each in­ dependently allow for accurate mapping of vegetation phenology under these challenging conditions. The study area is a rangeland with bimodal seasonality located at the 128-km2 Kapiti Farm in Machakos County, Kenya. Using all the available PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 imagery between March 2017 and February 2019, we derived temporal NDVI profiles and fitted double hyperbolic tangent models (equivalent to commonly-used logistic functions), separately for the two rainy seasons locally referred to as the short and long rains. We estimated startand end-of-season for the series using a 50\% threshold between minimum and maximum levels of the modelled time series (SOS50/EOS50). We compared our estimates against those obtained from vegetation index series from two alternative sources, i.e. a) greenness chromatic coordinate (GCC) series obtained from digital repeat pho­ tography, and b) MODIS NDVI. We found that both PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 series resulted in acceptable retrievals of phenology (RMSD of {\textasciitilde}8 days for SOS50 and {\textasciitilde}15 days for EOS50 when compared against GCC series) suggesting that the sensors individually provide sufficient temporal detail. However, when applying the model to the entire study area, fewer spatial artefacts occurred in the PlanetScope results. This could be explained by the higher observation frequency of PlanetScope, which becomes critical during periods of persistent cloud cover. We further illustrated that PlanetScope series could differentiate the phenology of individual trees from grass­ land surroundings, whereby tree green-up was found to be both earlier and later than for grass, depending on location. The spatially-detailed phenology retrievals, as achieved in this study, are expected to help in better understanding climate and degradation impacts on rangeland vegetation, particularly for heterogeneous ran­ geland systems with large interannual variability in phenology and productivity.},

	abstract = {Dense time series of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery are creating exciting new opportunities to monitor, map, and characterize temporal dynamics in land surface properties with unprecedented spatial detail and quality. By combining imagery from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and the MultiSpectral Instrument on-board Sentinel-2A and -2B, the remote sensing community now has access to moderate (10–30 m) spatial resolution imagery with repeat periods of {\textasciitilde}3 days in the mid-latitudes. At the same time, the large combined data volume from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 introduce substantial new challenges for users. Land surface phenology (LSP) algorithms, which estimate the timing of phenophase transitions and quantify the nature and magnitude of seasonality in remotely sensed land surface conditions, provide an intuitive way to reduce data volumes and redundancy, while also furnishing data sets that are useful for a wide range of applications including monitoring ecosystem response to climate variability and extreme events, ecosystem modelling, crop-type discrimination, and land cover, land use, and land cover change mapping, among others. To support the need for operational LSP data sets, here we describe a continental-scale land surface phenology algorithm and data product based on harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) imagery. The algorithm creates high quality times series of vegetation indices from HLS imagery, which are then used to estimate the timing of vegetation phenophase transitions at 30 m spatial resolution. We present results from assessment efforts evaluating LSP retrievals, and provide examples illustrating the character and quality of information related to land cover and terrestrial ecosystem properties provided by the continental LSP dataset that we have developed. The algorithm is highly successful in ecosystems with strong seasonal variation in leaf area (e.g., deciduous forests). Conversely, results in evergreen systems are less interpretable and conclusive.},

	abstract = {The current exponential increase of spatiotemporally explicit data streams from satellitebased Earth observation missions offers promising opportunities for global vegetation monitoring. Intelligent sampling through active learning (AL) heuristics provides a pathway for fast inference of essential vegetation variables by means of hybrid retrieval approaches, i.e., machine learning regression algorithms trained by radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations. In this study we summarize AL theory and perform a brief systematic literature survey about AL heuristics used in the context of Earth observation regression problems over terrestrial targets. Across all relevant studies it appeared that: (i) retrieval accuracy of AL-optimized training data sets outperformed models trained over large randomly sampled data sets, and (ii) Euclidean distance-based (EBD) diversity method tends to be the most efﬁcient AL technique in terms of accuracy and computational demand. Additionally, a case study is presented based on experimental data employing both uncertainty and diversity AL criteria. Hereby, a a simulated training data base by the PROSAIL-PRO canopy RTM is used to demonstrate the beneﬁt of AL techniques for the estimation of total leaf carotenoid content (Cxc) and leaf water content (Cw). Gaussian process regression (GPR) was incorporated to minimize and optimize the training data set with AL. Training the GPR algorithm on optimally AL-based sampled data sets led to improved variable retrievals compared to training on full data pools, which is further demonstrated on a mapping example. From these ﬁndings we can recommend the use of AL-based sub-sampling procedures to select the most informative samples out of large training data pools. This will not only optimize regression accuracy due to exclusion of redundant information, but also speed up processing time and reduce ﬁnal model size of kernel-based machine learning regression algorithms, such as GPR. With this study we want to encourage further testing and implementation of AL sampling methods for hybrid retrieval workﬂows. AL can contribute to the solution of regression problems within the framework of operational vegetation monitoring using satellite imaging spectroscopy data, and may strongly facilitate data processing for cloud-computing platforms.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral acquisitions have proven to be the most informative Earth observation data source for the estimation of nitrogen (N) content, which is the main limiting nutrient for plant growth and thus agricultural production. In the past, empirical algorithms have been widely employed to retrieve information on this biochemical plant component from canopy reﬂectance. However, these approaches do not seek for a cause-eﬀect relationship based on physical laws. Moreover, most studies solely relied on the correlation of chlorophyll content with nitrogen, and thus neglected the fact that most N is bound in proteins. Our study presents a hybrid retrieval method using a physically-based approach combined with machine learning regression to estimate crop N content. Within the workﬂow, the leaf optical properties model PROSPECT-PRO including the newly calibrated speciﬁc absorption coeﬃcients (SAC) of proteins, was coupled with the canopy reﬂectance model 4SAIL to PROSAIL-PRO. The latter was then employed to generate a training database to be used for advanced probabilistic machine learning methods: a standard homoscedastic Gaussian process (GP) and a heteroscedastic GP regression that accounts for signal-to-noise relations. Both GP models have the property of providing conﬁdence intervals for the estimates, which sets them apart from other machine learners. Moreover, a GP-based sequential backward band removal algorithm was employed to analyze the band-speciﬁc information content of PROSAIL-PRO simulated spectra for the estimation of aboveground N. Data from multiple hyperspectral ﬁeld campaigns, carried out in the framework of the future satellite mission Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), were exploited for validation. In these campaigns, corn and winter wheat spectra were acquired to simulate spectral EnMAP data. Moreover, destructive N measurements from leaves, stalks and fruits were collected separately to enable plant-organ-speciﬁc validation. The results showed that both GP models can provide accurate aboveground N simulations, with slightly better results of the heteroscedastic GP in terms of model testing and against in situ N measurements from leaves plus stalks, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.1 g/m². However, the inclusion of fruit N content for validation deteriorated the results, which can be explained by the inability of the radiation to penetrate the thick tissues of stalks, corn cobs and wheat ears. GPbased band analysis identiﬁed optimal spectral settings with ten bands mainly situated in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral region. Use of well-known protein absorption bands from the literature showed comparative results. Finally, the heteroscedastic GP model was successfully applied on airborne hyperspectral data for N mapping. We conclude that GP algorithms, and in particular the heteroscedastic GP, should be implemented for global agricultural monitoring of aboveground N from future imaging spectroscopy data.},

The increasing spatial and temporal resolution of globally available satellite images, such as those provided by Sentinel-2, creates new possibilities for generating accurate datasets on available crop types, in ready-to-use vector data format. Existing solutions dedicated to cropland mapping, based on high resolution remote sensing data, are mainly focused on pixel-based analysis of time series data. This paper evaluates how a time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) method that uses Sentinel-2 time series performs when applied to pixel-based and object-based classiﬁcations of various crop types in three diﬀerent study areas (in Romania, Italy and the USA). The classiﬁcation outputs were compared to those produced by Random Forest (RF) for both pixel- and object-based image analysis units. The sensitivity of these two methods to the training samples was also evaluated. Object-based TWDTW outperformed pixel-based TWDTW in all three study areas, with overall accuracies ranging between 78.05\% and 96.19\%; it also proved to be more eﬃcient in terms of computational time. TWDTW achieved comparable classiﬁcation results to RF in Romania and Italy, but RF achieved better results in the USA, where the classiﬁed crops present high intra-class spectral variability. Additionally, TWDTW proved to be less sensitive in relation to the training samples. This is an important asset in areas where inputs for training samples are limited.},

	abstract = {Image processing entered the era of artiﬁcial intelligence, and machine learning algorithms emerged as attractive alternatives for time series data processing. Satellite image time series processing enables crop phenology monitoring, such as the calculation of start and end of season. Among the promising algorithms, Gaussian process regression (GPR) proved to be a competitive time series gap-ﬁlling algorithm with the advantage of, as developed within a Bayesian framework, providing associated uncertainty estimates. Nevertheless, the processing of time series images becomes computationally inefﬁcient in its standard per-pixel usage, mainly for GPR training rather than the ﬁtting step. To mitigate this computational burden, we propose to substitute the per-pixel optimization step with the creation of a cropland-based precalculations for the GPR hyperparameters θ. To demonstrate our approach hardly affects the accuracy in ﬁtting, we used Sentinel-2 LAI time series over an agricultural region in Castile and Leon, North-West Spain. The performance of image reconstructions were compared against the standard per-pixel GPR time series processing. Results showed that accuracies were on the same order (RMSE 0.1767 vs. 0.1564 [m2/m2], 12\% RMSE degradation) whereas processing time accelerated about 90 times. We further evaluated the alternative option of using the same hyperparameters for all the pixels within the complete scene. It led to similar overall accuracies over crop areas and computational performance. Crop phenology indicators were also calculated for the three different approaches and compared. Results showed analogous crop temporal patterns, with differences in start and end of growing season of no more than ﬁve days. To the beneﬁt of crop monitoring applications, all the gap-ﬁlling and phenology indicators retrieval techniques have been implemented into the freely downloadable GUI toolbox DATimeS.},

The mechanisms involved are complex and intertwined, hence undermining the identification of simple adaptation levers to help improve the resilience of agricultural production. Based on more than 82 000 yield data reported at the regional level in 17 European countries, we assess how climate affected the yields of nine crop species. Using machine learning models, we analyzed historical yield data since 1901 and then focus on 2018, which has experienced a multiplicity and a diversity of atypical extreme climatic conditions. Machine learning models explain up to 65\% of historical yield anomalies. We find that both extremes in temperature and precipitation are associated with negative yield anomalies, but with varying impacts in different parts of Europe. In 2018, Northern and Eastern Europe experienced multiple and simultaneous crop failures—among the highest observed in recent decades. These yield losses were associated with extremely low rainfalls in combination with high temperatures between March and August 2018. However, the higher than usual yields recorded in Southern Europe—caused by favourable spring rainfall conditions—nearly offset the large decrease in Northern European crop production. Our results outline the importance of considering single and compound climate extremes to analyse the causes of yield losses in Europe. We found no clear upward or downward trend in the frequency of extreme yield losses for any of the considered crops between 1990 and 2018.

	abstract = {The accurate retrieval of land surface vegetation properties under varying environmental conditions from time series of moderately high spatial resolution satellite observations is challenging. By coupling various Radiative Transfer (RT) models one can describe the soil, vegetation and atmosphere contributions in a “bottom-up” approach and, thereby, simulate top-of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance data comparable to satellite-observed TOA radiances. This makes it possible to retrieve vegetation properties directly from TOA radiances rather than from atmospherically corrected top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance data. The advantages of this approach are that a separate atmospheric correction of the satellite images is not necessary, and that the anisotropic surface reflection can also be taken into account effectively. In this study, we coupled various RT models, including the brightness – shape – moisture (BSM) reflectance model of the soil, the optical radiative transfer (RTMo) model of vegetation and the ‘MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission’ (MODTRAN) model of the atmosphere, to simulate an annual time series of Landsat satellite TOA radiances observed during a drought episode in California Mediterranean grasslands in 2004. The inversion of this coupled system through an optimization technique against Landsat TOA radiances resulted in direct retrieval of vegetation properties. We accommodated the surface anisotropic reflection in our coupled modeling and also defined a novel anisotropy index to quantitatively express the importance of this phenomenon in satellite image analysis for the first time. Our study showed that the coupled use of RT models was able to accurately reproduce the time series of observed TOA radiances collected under varying soil moisture contents during an extended drought episode. The proposed coupling approach is useful for successful retrieval of vegetation properties from time series of satellite TOA radiance data to produce maps of land surface properties and to monitor vegetation properties variations in an operational straightforward way. The approach can also be easily adapted for conducting multi-sensor time series studies, creating a much denser temporal sampling than would be possible for separate single sensors.},

In particular, novel lightweight 2D spectral imagers in combination with UAVs are increasingly being adapted for imaging spectroscopy. In contrast to traditional linescanners, these sensors capture spectral information as a 2D image within every exposure. With computer vision algorithms embedded in consumer grade software packages, these data can be processed to hyperspectral digital surface models that hold spectral and 3D spatial information in very high resolution. To understand the spectral signal, however, one must comprehend the complexity of the capturing and data processing process in imaging spectroscopy with 2D imagers.},
