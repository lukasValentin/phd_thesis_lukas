\section*{Abstract}
Timely knowledge of phenological development and crop growth is pivotal for evidence-based decision making in agriculture. We propose a near real-time approach combining radiative transfer model inversion with physiological and phenological priors from multi-year field phenotyping. Our approach allows to retrieve Green Leaf Area Index (GLAI), Canopy Chlorophyll Content (CCC) and hence Leaf Chlorophyll Content (Cab) from Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery to quantify winter wheat growth conditions in a physiologically sound way. Phenological macro stages are based on accumulated growing degree day thresholds obtained from multi-year field phenotyping covering more than 2400 ratings from roughly 300 winter wheat varieties and reflect important physiological transitions. These include the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth and the onset of flowering, which is important information for agricultural decision support. Validation against a large data set of on-farm trials in Switzerland collected in 2019 and 2022 revealed high accuracy of our approach that produced spatio-temporally consistent results. Phenological macro stages were predicted for 970 Sentinel-2 observations reaching a weighted F1-score of 0.96. Sentinel-2 derived \gls{GLAI} and \gls{CCC} explained between 77 to 84\% and between 79 to 84\% of the variability in in-situ measurements, respectively. Here, the incorporation of phenological priors clearly increased trait retrieval accuracy. Besides, this work highlights that physiological priors, e.g., obtained by field phenotyping, can help enhancing landscape scale observations and hold potential to advance the retrieval of remotely sensed vegetation traits and in-season phenology.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:insights_introduction}
Timely knowledge of crop growth and phenological development is pivotal for evidence-based decision making in agriculture. Estimating current and historical growing conditions can increase the resource use efficiency of inputs such as fertilizer, water or pesticides~\citep{bach_sustainable_2018}. By determining phenology and growth in a timely manner, the right amount of these inputs can be applied at the right time~\citep{pedersen_precision_2017,argento_site-specific_2021}. Therefore, accurate, traceable and timely information about crop growth and phenology is required by many stakeholders in agriculture including agricultural agencies, insurers, individual farmers and actors from the downstream value-chain. Further, accurate estimation of crop growth plays a crucial role in global food security such as the GEOGLAM crop monitor~\citep{becker-reshef_strengthening_2020}. The authors reported that the main readership included not only governments but also private sector actors such as individual farmers, demonstrating the relevance of information about crop growth at different institutional levels. Another prominent example of this is the European Union's crop monitoring and yield forecasting JRC MARS Bulletin), which has provided crop growth information requested by stakeholders in business, academia and governmental agencies since 1993 \citep{van_der_velde_use_2019}.

Arguably, knowledge about plant growth and development is invaluable for understanding plant-environment interactions not only in agriculture but in terrestrial ecosystems in general \citep{zhu_greening_2016}.
To gain this knowledge it is essential to develop a holistic understanding of drivers of plant growth and phenology at the landscape scale. Here, it must be ensured that observed differences between geographic locations and years are caused by physiological responses of plants to their environment~\citep{korner_tools_2021} and not due to differences in data quality or data processing.

In winter wheat (\textsl{Triticum aestivum}) - one of the world's most important staple crops - three major phenological stages are distinguished: germination to end of tillering (GE-ET), stem elongation to end of heading (SE-EH), and flowering to physiological maturity (FL-PM) ~\citep{hay_convergence_1991}. The transition from tillering to stem elongation marks the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth and is important for the timing of nitrogen fertilizer application. Moreover, the duration of SE determines the number of fertile florets \citep{gonzalez_grain_2003}, while the onset of flowering increases the susceptibility of wheat to weather-related damage such as hail ~\citep{holman_impact_2022}. In addition, functional crop traits such as \gls{GLAI} or \gls{CCC} quantify growth conditions ~\citep{gitelson_relationships_2014} and provide inference on secondary traits such as biomass accumulation ~\citep{gitelson_remote_2003}, yield ~\citep{huang_improving_2015,chen_improving_2018,hashimoto_feasibility_2022} and nutrient supply ~\citep{delloye_retrieval_2018}. \gls{GLAI} quantifies the photosynthetically active leaf area per unit ground area and is directly proportional to gross photosynthesis ~\citep{gitelson_remote_2003}. The amount of photosynthetically absorbed radiation is largely determined by \gls{CCC}, which is the product of the \gls{Cab} content of green leaves scaled-up to the canopy ~\citep{gitelson_relationships_2014}.

Conceptual understanding of winter wheat growth and development stems from multi-year field phenotyping experiments. Field phenotyping aims to quantitatively describe plants by a set of observable morphological, biochemical and physiological traits under natural environment conditions ~\citep{walter_plant_2015}. For this purpose, imaging techniques on handheld and close-range sensing platforms are used, among others, to enable large sample sizes in trait acquisition of field crops~\citep{araus_field_2014}. It is important to note here that field phenotyping goes beyond simply collecting plant traits. In field phenotyping, plant traits are linked to environmental covariates such as air temperature or global radiation to provide a more holistic picture of plant-environment interactions. A covariate often missing in field phenotyping, however, is the continuous spatial component as experimental setups are mainly designed to understand genotype-specific (i.e., variety-specific) responses to meteorological covariates such as temperature. Differences in spatially continuous variables such as soil properties or topography and their effect on plant growth are hardly captured by current phenotyping experiments. Therefore, it remains often unclear to what degree findings from field phenotyping experiments are applicable to agricultural landscapes. Remote sensing appears as a logical tool to incorporate the missing continuous spatial component with wide-area coverage and comparably low costs of data acquisition and processing ~\citep{weiss_remote_2020}. Surprisingly, research in agricultural remote sensing has so far made little use of concepts and theories from field phenotyping such as temperature-response curves~\citep{roth_phenomics_2022} and applied them on the landscape scale ~\citep{machwitz_bridging_2021}. For example, many remote sensing studies do not fully address underlying physiological processes that control plant growth. Arguably, bringing both fields together has huge potential~\citep{walter_advances_2022}.

In the toolbox of remote sensing, physically-based \gls{RTM}s simulate plant spectral properties based on a set of leaf and canopy traits. However, the inversion of \gls{RTM}s required to derive these traits from optical imagery is ill-posed, i.e., an analytical solution does not exist ~\citep{combal_retrieval_2002,atzberger_object-based_2004}. To cope with ill-posedness, the usage of prior information has been highlighted to limit the range and number of potential solutions ~\citep[for example]{lauvernet_multitemporal-patch_2008}. Still, the usage of physiologically sound priors available from field phenotyping such as ratings of leaf and canopy traits has been little. A similar finding can be made for remote sensing of phenology: Phenology estimates mainly relate to mathematical properties of time series of spectral indices ~\citep{de_beurs_land_2004,garonna_variability_2016,peng_scaling_2017,bolton_continental-scale_2020}. Remotely sensed phenology usually means Land Surface Phenology~\citep{de_beurs_land_2004} which aims to describe seasonal patterns of vegetation development by greenness proxies~\citep{helman_land_2018}. Most of these remotely sensed phenology estimates therefore do not allow full physiological interpretability. As a consequence, these estimates can be difficult to compare in space and time, which is important for agricultural management. Moreover, most approaches require complete, gap-free time series \citep[for instance]{lobert_deep_2023}, which makes it hardly possible to determine phenological phases during the growing season in near real-time ~\citep{liao_near_2023}. In-season estimates of phenology are, however, crucial for agricultural decision support due to the time-criticality of most management operations in agriculture, such as fertilizing.

To overcome the identified gaps and limitations we propose an approach combining remotely sensed imagery with multi-year field phenotyping. We focus on \gls{S2} optical satellite imagery which has been intensively used for agricultural applications ~\citep{delloye_retrieval_2018,meroni_comparing_2021,chen_improving_2022}. In detail, \gls{S2} offers a high spectral resolution with 13 bands between 442 and 2202 nm. Out of these, 10 bands with a spatial resolution of 10 to 20 m can be used for analyzing vegetation parameters. Thanks to the twin constellation of the S2A and S2B satellites, the temporal resolution reaches up to three days in mid-latitudes required to track vegetation dynamics ~\citep{frampton_evaluating_2013}. Geographically, our research focuses on Switzerland. Switzerland is exemplary for intensively-farmed landscapes. Not only serves it as a blueprint for other highly industrialized farming systems but also for small-scale farming structures due to the small average farm (around 21 ha in 2021,~\citep{federal_statistical_office_landwirtschaft_2022}) and field parcel size. 

Our aim is to test if concepts and theories from field phenotyping experiments can be applied at the landscape-scale using satellite remote sensing. Thus, we propose to combine the spatio-temporal component from satellite remote sensing with conceptual understanding about crop physiology and phenological macro stages from field phenotyping. This poses two specific research questions: 
\begin{itemize}
\item First, can field phenotyping and \gls{S2} data be used to estimate phenological macro stages in-season on the landscape scale?
\item Second, do physiological and phenological priors from field phenotyping improve RTM-based trait retrieval on the landscape scale? 
\end{itemize}
Our paper is structured accordingly: We describe the field phenotyping, validation and remote sensing data in Section \ref{sec:data}, which are required for setting up our workflow to combine phenotyping with satellite remote sensing. We explain the actual model calibration, inference and validation in Section \ref{sec:insights_methods} followed by a presentation of results in Section \ref{sec:insights_results} and a discussion of these in Section \ref{sec:insights_discussion}.


\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
Based on our objective, three different types of data are required: field phenotyping data (Section \ref{subsec:phenotyping-data}), independent on-farm trial data at the landscape scale (Section \ref{subsec:on-farm-trials}), and \gls{S2} remote sensing imagery (Section \ref{subsec:rs-data}).

\subsection{Field Phenotyping Data}
\label{subsec:phenotyping-data}
Multi-year field phenotyping data were acquired at different sites and years in Switzerland and Southern Germany. Table \ref{tab:phenotyping-datasources} summarizes the sites from which field phenotyping data was available.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{FIP Site}
\label{subsubsec:fip-data}
Multi-year phenology data were acquired at the FIP field phenotyping site ~\citep{kirchgessner_eth_2017} located at the agricultural research station of ETH at Lindau-Eschikon (see Table \ref{tab:phenotyping-datasources} and red star in Figure \ref{fig:overview-map}). At the FIP site Swiss and European winter wheat varieties from the GABI wheat panel~\citep{gogna_gabi_2022} are grown in two lots (lot size 36 $\times$ 40 m), allowing a randomized plot design with two full replications. Each lot is subdivided into 398 plots of 1.0 $\times$ 1.4 m, in each of which a different winter wheat variety is grown. The site is managed according to Swiss regulations for conventional farming. The site is equipped with a weather station from which temperature readings were taken.

For the beginning of SE (BBCH 31) data were available from 2020 until 2022 resulting in a total of 357 ratings. For EH (BBCH 59) data from six years (2015 - 2020) could be used.

\subsubsection{SEON}
\label{subsubsec:seon-data}
Within the Swiss Earth Observatory Network (SEON) ~\citep{liebisch_characterization_2014} GLAI, \gls{CCC} and phenology was collected in 2014 at different winter wheat field parcels in north-eastern Switzerland (see Table \ref{tab:phenotyping-datasources}) at a distance of 20 km to the FIP site (see Section \ref{subsubsec:fip-data}). The data was sampled on farmers' fields managed according to Swiss agricultural practice. Weather data was available from the Swiss Meteorological Office (MeteoSwiss).

\subsubsection{MNI}
\label{subsubsec:mni-data}
The Munich-North-Isar (MNI,~\citep{danner_fitted_2019,wocher_physically-based_2018}) dataset contains joined ratings of phenology, GLAI, and \gls{CCC} from winter wheat parcels located north the city of Munich, Germany, from five consecutive years (see Table \ref{tab:phenotyping-datasources}). The winter wheat parcels were managed according to local agricultural practice. Meteorological data was available from a nearby weather station operated by the German National Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD).

\subsubsection{Bramenwies}
\label{subsubsec:bramenwies-data}
A single winter wheat parcel managed according to Swiss conventional standards was monitored in 2022 with high spatial and temporal sampling frequency resulting in 909 readings of phenology and \gls{GLAI} (see Table \ref{tab:phenotyping-datasources}). The parcel is located in close proximity (2 km) to the FIP site. Weather data were available from a nearby weather station.

\subsection{On-farm trials}
\label{subsec:on-farm-trials}

In-situ reference data for validating the S2-derived functional crop traits and phenological macro stages was collected in 2019 and 2022 in winter wheat field parcels distributed across Switzerland (Figure \ref{fig:overview-map}). All sites are located in the Swiss midlands characterized by a temperate climate (annual mean air temperature around 10 deg C) and humid conditions (annual precipitation sum around 1000 mm). Winter wheat is the most important staple crop in Switzerland. In Switzerland wheat is usually sown in October or November and harvested in July the year after.

Site characteristics are denoted in Table \ref{tab:site_characteristics} including parcel size, winter wheat variety, management scheme, and  number of sampling points. In 2022, a total of seven winter wheat parcels at four study sites was investigated and regularly monitored during the main growing season (March till June). In 2019, measurements from two winter wheat parcels located at "Swiss Future Farm" were taken (Figure \ref{fig:overview-map} lower right) on April 15, 2019. These parcels were part of a nitrogen fertilization experiment and sub-divided into non-randomized treatment blocks where the effect of uniform and variable rate nitrogen fertilization on field heterogeneity was studied. The width of the treatment plots was 15 or 30 m corresponding to one or two times the operational range of the fertilizer spreader, respectively. The length varied between 40 and 90 m. The treatment zones with a width of 15 m - all of them were located at the field boundaries - were excluded from analysis. Further details about the experiment description can be found in ~\cite{argento_investigating_2022} and a map of the design in Figure \ref{fig:appendix_sff_2019}.

Meteorological data was acquired from weather stations located in close proximity to the field parcels operated by the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology, MeteoSwiss (Arenenberg, Swiss Future Farm, and Witzwil), and by the AgroMeteo network of the Federal Swiss Center for Excellence in Agricultural Research, Agroscope (Strickhof).

\subsection{S2 Remote Sensing Imagery}
\label{subsec:rs-data}

S2 surface reflectance data (processing level 2A) with a scene-wide cloud cover of $\le$50\% were acquired from the Data and Information Access Services (DIAS) platform CREODIAS\footnote{\url{https:\\creodias.eu}} between 1st of March and 31st of July 2022 and April to May 2019. All \gls{S2} scenes were atmospherically-corrected using Sen2Cor version 2.10 (payload data ground segment baseline N0400).

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:insights_methods}
% \input{Methods.tex}
We start with describing how the \gls{S2} imagery (Section \ref{subsec:process-s2}) was pre-processed, phenology (Section \ref{subsubsec:phenology-recoding}) and functional trait data (Section \ref{subsubsec:trait-measurement}) were measured in-situ, and how the meteorological data were converted to thermal time (Section \ref{subsubsec:meteo-data-processing}). Next, we describe the workflow from i) model calibration using field phenotyping data (Section \ref{subsec:model-calibration}) to ii) model inference on \gls{S2} imagery (Section \ref{subsec:model-inference}) to iii) model validation using data from on-farm trials (Section \ref{subsec:model-validation}). The source code to reproduce the entire workflow is openly available under GNU General Public License v3.0 (see \ref{sec:insights_code-data-availability}).

\subsection{Processing of \gls{S2} imagery}
\label{subsec:process-s2}
We resampled the 20 m \gls{S2} bands to 10 m spatial resolution. All 10 and 20 m bands were used except band 8 (832 nm central wavelength) resulting in a total of 9 bands considered. Band 8 was disregarded in favor of band 8A which has a higher spectral resolution and showed more accurate results in prior testing. In a next step, we clipped the \gls{S2} scenes to the extent of the field parcels using the open-source Python Earth Observation Data Analysis Library (EOdal, ~\citet{graf_eodal_2022}). We used the scene classification layer (SCL) of the Sen2Cor output to filter out all pixels except those classified as vegetated (SCL class 4) or bare soil (SCL class 5) to avoid contamination by clouds, shadows and snow.

\subsection{In-Situ data processing}
\label{subsec:in-situ-data-processing}

\subsubsection{Recording of phenology}
\label{subsubsec:phenology-recoding}
All measurements of \gls{GLAI} and \gls{CCC} at the field phenotyping (Section \ref{subsec:phenotyping-data}) and on-farm trial sites (Section \ref{subsec:on-farm-trials}) were linked to phenological stages. Phenological stages were expressed using the Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt and CHemical Industry (BBCH) scale. At all sites the rating of BBCH stages followed the work by~\citet{lancashire_uniform_1991}. Here, the rating of the transition between the three phenological macro stages considered deserves further detail, i.e., the beginning of SE (BBCH stage 31) and EH (BBCH stage 59).

SE (BBCH 31) was determined by cutting the main tiller lengthwise and measuring the distance between the first node and the tillering node following the manual by~\cite{pask_physiological_2012}. If the distance was >= 1 cm, the stage was recorded as BBCH 31. EH (BBCH 59) was determined as the stage when the inflorescence was fully emerged. The beginning of flowering (BBCH 61) was recorded when the first anthers became visible.

\subsubsection{Measurement of functional traits}
\label{subsubsec:trait-measurement}

\paragraph{Green Leaf Area Index}
GLAI was measured using destructive sampling at early growth stages and non-destructively after the onset of stem elongation (BBCH $>$33). For destructive sampling, the total surface biomass of a previously defined ground surface was sampled, with plants from at least two seed rows. From five to six randomly selected wheat plants in this sample, we took the top complete developed leaf (including leaf base) and placed them on a screen with known reference area. We determined the leaf area of these leaves $A_{leaf}$ by image segmentation, i.e., separated the leaves from the screen background. Subsequently, the total biomass as well as the leaves used for segmentation were freeze-dried for at least 48 hours and their dry weight was determined ($m_{total}$ and $m_{leaf}$, respectively). Using $m_{total}$ and $m_{leaf}$, we computed the total leaf area and, using the known ground area $A_{ground}$, the \gls{GLAI} (Equation \ref{eq:destructive-glai}).

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:destructive-glai}
    \gls{GLAI} = \frac{A_{leaf} * \frac{m_{total}}{m_{leaf}}}{A_{ground}}
\end{equation}

From BBCH stage 33 onwards, this approach was no longer feasible as the increasing length of the leaves exceeded the reference grid. We therefore used a LAI-2200C Plant Canopy Analyzer by LI-COR Biosciences with a 45 degree viewing cap, performing replicates in three different orientations, each offset by 90 degrees. To avoid contamination of the measurement by direct sunlight, the measurements were mostly performed in the morning hours or under diffuse (cloudy) light conditions. A comparison of destructive and non-destructive methods was performed for individual data points and showed good agreement. \gls{GLAI} measurements were continued until the onset of senescence in the lower leaf layers. Only at the SEON (Section \ref{subsubsec:seon-data}) and MNI (Section \ref{subsubsec:mni-data}) sites \gls{GLAI} rating were continued after the onset of senescence estimating the fraction of non-photosynthetic leaf area by eye.

\paragraph{Canopy Chlorophyll Content}
CCC was estimated by destructively determining leaf chlorophyll content and GLAI. In 2019, the biomass samples were collected at experimental plots of the nitrogen fertilization experiments by~\cite{argento_investigating_2022} (see Section \ref{subsec:on-farm-trials}). For each plot, leaves were randomly selected. In 2022, the entire above ground biomass of two up to four seed rows at the sampling points was collected at a pre-defined distance. A randomly selected sub-sample was used for chlorophyll analysis. In both years, immediately after sampling, the leaves were frozen. In addition, the area of these leaves was determined in the same way as for \gls{GLAI} to determine leaf mass per unit area. To avoid light damage, samples were stored in the dark. The frozen samples were weighed in a cooled container and freeze dried. After freeze drying, the samples were milled and prepared for the extraction. For this process, 50 $mg$ of the milled sample were mixed with ethanol (95\%, Analytical Grade) and the supernatant was removed from the sample for the analysis. This step was repeated two times or until the remaining pellet was of white-yellowish colour. In order to determine the pigment concentration in the supernatant, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 470 nm ($A_{470}$), 649 nm ($A_{649}$) and 664 nm ($A_{664}$) with a Microtitre plate reader (Infinite® M1000, Tecan) using a sample volume of 200 $\mu l$ with two replicates. From the absorbance the chlorophyll a ($c_a$) and b ($c_b$) and a+b ($c_{ab}$) content in $\mu g$ $ml^{-1}$ was calculated using the formula provided by~\citet{lichtenthaler_chlorophylls_2001}:

\begin{equation}
    c_a = 13.36 A_{664} - 5.19 A_{649}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    c_b = 27.43 A_{649} - 8.12 A_{664}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    c_{ab} = \frac{1000 A_{470} - 2.13 c_a - 97.64 c_b}{209}
    \label{eq:cab-tecan}
\end{equation}

The chlorophyll concentration obtained from Equation \ref{eq:cab-tecan} was related to leaf area using the known probe volume (200 $\mu l$ ethanol) and weight of the sample biomass (50 $mg$) dissolved in it. Using the LMA of the leaves the sample biomass was taken from we could then calculate the leaf chlorophyll content per area in $\mu g$ $cm^{-2}$ and scale it up to \gls{CCC} using Equation \ref{eq:ccc-calc-rtm}. The required \gls{GLAI} values were obtained from Equation \ref{eq:destructive-glai} based on the larger biomass samples or LI-COR measurements that were acquired in parallel to the leaf samples.

\subsubsection{Meteorological data processing}
\label{subsubsec:meteo-data-processing}

We used the daily mean air temperature 2 m above ground ($T_{abs}d$) from weather stations to calculate growing degree days (GDD, ~\cite{mcmaster_growing_1997}) for winter wheat assuming a base temperature ($T_{base}$) of zero degrees Celsius (Equation \ref{eq:GDD}). We obtained accumulative GDD (AGDD) by accumulating all GDDs obtained from Eq. \ref{eq:GDD} between the sowing and harvest date as reported by field calendars at the phenotyping (Table \ref{tab:phenotyping-datasources}) and on-farm sites (Figure \ref{fig:overview-map}).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GDD}
    GDD =
    \begin{cases}
        T_{abs}d & \text{if } T_{abs}d > T_{base} \\
        0 &  T_{abs}d \le T_{base}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Model Calibration}
\label{subsec:model-calibration}
For establishing physiologically plausible \gls{RTM} inputs at the leaf and canopy level we consider correlations between leaf and canopy parameters (Section \ref{subsubsec:physiological-constraints}) and the dependency of \gls{GLAI} to phenology and the dependency of phenology on air temperature (Section \ref{subsubsec:phenological-constraints}). All these insights are obtained from field phenotyping described in Section \ref{subsec:phenotyping-data} using the pre-processing methods explained in Section \ref{subsec:in-situ-data-processing}.

\subsubsection{Physiological Priors}
\label{subsubsec:physiological-constraints}

CCC and \gls{GLAI} are closely correlated ~\citep{gitelson_remote_2005,gitelson_relationships_2014,gitelson_uncertainty_2022}. Following the approach proposed by ~\cite{wocher_rtm-based_2020} to account for the correlation between carotenoid (Car) and \gls{Cab} content we established a relationship between \gls{CCC} and \gls{GLAI} to increase the physiological plausibility of \gls{RTM} inputs using phenotyping data from the SEON and MNI sites (see Table \ref{tab:phenotyping-datasources} and Sections \ref{subsubsec:seon-data} and \ref{subsubsec:mni-data}).

Figure \ref{fig:lai-ccc-relationship} shows a strong linear relationship between \gls{CCC} and \gls{GLAI} obtained from field phenotyping with Pearson's $R^2$ 0.94 (N=137). We fitted a linear regression line to the data points and constructed an upper and lower envelope encompassing all data points. The linear regression with obtained coefficients is given in Equation \ref{eq:lin-regress}.

% linear regression formula
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lin-regress}
    \gls{CCC} = 0.5755 \gls{GLAI}  % + 3.6287e^{-29}
\end{equation}

To fit the upper envelope, we used all CCC-GLAI pairs recorded before flowering (BBCH 61). Thus, we accounted for plant development during the vegetative (till BBCH 29) and reproductive phase in which \gls{CCC} and \gls{GLAI} are increasing steadily. A linear model was constructed and is denoted in Equation \ref{eq:upper-envelop}.

% upper envelop formula
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:upper-envelop}
    CCC_{upper} = 0.8544 \gls{GLAI} % + 3.4852e^{-16}
\end{equation}

For the lower envelope we used all CCC-GLAI pairs recorded after BBCH 61. Here, we assume \gls{CCC} and \gls{GLAI} to decline with onset of senescence. We used a second order polynomial to construct the envelope (Equation \ref{eq:lower-envelop}). The reason for choosing a linear and polynomial model for the upper and lower envelope, respectively, follows the reasoning by~\cite{gitelson_relationships_2014}: During vegetative growth stages, the relationship between \gls{GLAI} and \gls{CCC} is strongly linear but tends to become polynomial for reproductive stages after flowering due to hysteresis effects.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lower-envelop}
    CCC_{lower} = 0.0763 * \left(\frac{GLAI}{1.6819}\right)^2 + 0.3336 * \frac{GLAI}{1.6819} - 0.0551
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption[Empirical relationship between \gls{CCC} and \gls{GLAI} (N=137) obtained from field phenotyping data.

The upper and lower envelope of the data are plotted fit for the data points recorded before and after flowering, respectively.}
    \label{fig:lai-ccc-relationship}
\end{figure}

Following the approach by ~\cite{wocher_rtm-based_2020} we used the regression line and the envelopes to distribute \gls{CCC} values using a truncated Laplacian distribution based on GLAI. Figure \ref{fig:constraints-in-lut} illustrates the principle: The left column in Figure \ref{fig:constraints-in-lut} (a, c, e) shows the relationship between \gls{CCC} and \gls{GLAI} (a), \gls{Cab} and \gls{GLAI} (c), and Car and \gls{Cab} (e), when no physiological priors are included and the traits are, thus, uncorrelated. Here, a truncated normal distribution is assumed for \gls{Cab} ($\mathscr{N} (50,40)$ $\mu g$ $cm^{-2}$) with a minimum of 0 and maximum of 80 $\mu g$ $cm^{-2}$ as suggested by~\cite{danner_efficient_2021}. Based on the same reference we obtained the uncorrelated Car samples (Figure \ref{fig:constraints-in-lut}e) with a minimum of 0 and maximum of 15 $\mu g$ $cm^{-2}$ using ($\mathscr{N} (7.5,5)$ $\mu g$ $cm^{-2}$). Our proposed workflow starts at Figure \ref{fig:constraints-in-lut}a with the redistribution of the \gls{CCC} values based on the empirical relationship from Figure \ref{fig:lai-ccc-relationship} using Equations \ref{eq:lin-regress} to \ref{eq:lower-envelop}. The result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:constraints-in-lut}b: Low \gls{CCC} values do not occur when \gls{GLAI} values are high, which is consistent with the literature~\citep{gitelson_relationships_2014}. Using the redistributed \gls{CCC} from Figure \ref{fig:constraints-in-lut}b, we redistributed Cab, using:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ccc-calc-rtm}
    CCC\ (g\ cm^{-2}) = \gls{Cab} * \gls{GLAI} * 0.01
\end{equation}
which can be rewritten to
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ccc-calc-rtm_inv}
    Cab\ (\mu g\ cm^{2}) = \frac{CCC}{GLAI} * 100
\end{equation}
to calculate \gls{Cab} from \gls{CCC} and GLAI. The result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:constraints-in-lut}d: Low \gls{Cab} values are removed when \gls{GLAI} is high. In a last step, we used the redistributed \gls{Cab} to implement the Car-Cab relation described in ~\cite{wocher_rtm-based_2020}. The result is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:constraints-in-lut}f. Thus, based on GLAI, CCC, \gls{Cab} and Car are redistributed and mutually correlated based on empirical relationships from field phenotyping to establish physiologically plausible \gls{RTM} inputs.

\subsubsection{Phenological Priors}
\label{subsubsec:phenological-constraints}
\paragraph{Dependency of \gls{GLAI} on phenology}

As described in Section \ref{subsec:phenotyping-data}, \gls{CCC} at the canopy as well as \gls{Cab} and Car at the leaf scale are distributed based on \gls{GLAI} (Figure \ref{fig:constraints-in-lut}b, d, f). \gls{GLAI} in turn depends on phenology. From the SEON, MNI and Bramenwies datasets (see Table \ref{tab:phenotyping-datasources} and Sections \ref{subsubsec:seon-data} to \ref{subsubsec:bramenwies-data}) we analyzed the measured \gls{GLAI} values using the 5, 50 and 95\% quantile. Analysis was carried out for all phenological stages (BBCH 0-99), as well as for GE-ET (BBCH 0-29), SE-EH (BBCH 31-59) and FL-PM (BBCH 61-99). The obtained descriptive statistics are shown in Table \ref{tab:glai-data}.

\end{table}

\paragraph{Dependency of phenology on air temperature}

Air temperature is an important driver of plant growth and phenological development~\citep{parent_temperature_2012, roth_high-throughput_2022}. We used the FIP field phenotyping data about the beginning of SE (BBCH 31) and EH (BBCH 59) to obtain descriptive statistics of the AGDD required for a winter wheat cultivar to reach these phenological stages. The descriptive statistics showing the 5, 50 and 95\% quantile are summarized in Table \ref{tab:bbch-agdd}.

\end{table}


\subsubsection{Radiative Transfer Modelling}
We used the PROSAIL \gls{RTM} ~\citep{jacquemoud_prospectsail_2009} coupling the PROSPECT-D leaf \gls{RTM} \citep{feret_prospect-d_2017} with the 4SAIL~\citep{verhoef_light_1984} canopy \gls{RTM} to simulate winter wheat directional reflectance based on the proposed physiological and phenological priors (Sections \ref{subsubsec:physiological-constraints} and \ref{subsubsec:phenological-constraints}). PROSAIL is a one-dimensional \gls{RTM} based on the turbid medium assumption meaning that canopies are treated as two-dimensional layers with scattering and absorbing particles. Three-dimensional structural effects are neglected. Viewing and illumination angles were set to scene-specific values. In PROSAIL, chlorophyll content is a leaf variable, Cab, (i.e., a variable of PROSPECT-D) given in $\mu g$ $cm^{-2}$. For scaling up to the canopy, we calculated \gls{CCC} (in $g$ $m^{-2}$) based on \gls{GLAI} (Equation \ref{eq:ccc-calc-rtm}).

Table \ref{tab:prosail-inputs} shows the leaf (PROSPECT-D) and canopy (4SAIL) parameters input into PROSAIL. The range of \gls{GLAI} values denoted in Table \ref{tab:prosail-inputs} is set to the range found for all phenological phases (BBCH 0-99). For the phenological macro stages, the range of \gls{GLAI} values is modified according to the 5-95\% quantile range denoted in Table \ref{tab:glai-data} (see Section \ref{subsubsec:phenological-constraints}) to integrate the phenological prior. In all phenological stages \gls{GLAI} is distributed uniformly. Leaf parameters \gls{Cab} and Car are redistributed based on \gls{GLAI} as described in Section \ref{subsubsec:physiological-constraints} to ensure physiological plausibility of PROSAIL simulations. The remaining parameters are set to values provided by~\cite{wocher_rtm-based_2020} and~\cite{danner_efficient_2021}, which are also based on in-situ data including winter wheat samples.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Thus, for each \gls{S2} scene we generated four \gls{LUT}s: Three \gls{LUT}s for the phenological macro stages (GE-ET, SE-EH, FL-PM) and a single \gls{LUT} for all stages (BBCH 0-99). We used a fully randomized sampling scheme to generate input pairs of leaf and canopy parameters from Table \ref{tab:prosail-inputs} to run PROSAIL in forward mode. After running PROSAIL, we carried out further post-processing: We discarded simulated spectra that had a physiologically unrealistic blue shift of the green reflectance peak as proposed by ~\cite{wocher_rtm-based_2020}. In detail,~\cite{wocher_rtm-based_2020} analyzed data from handheld field spectrometers, airborne hyperspectral imaging sensors and the ANGERS leaf optical dataset~\citep{jacquemoud_angers_2003}. They observed that green reflectance peaks of vegetation do not occur at wavelengths < 547 nm. PROSAIL, however, sometimes simulates vegetation spectra in which the green peak is shifted towards shorted wavelengths (i.e., < 547 nm). This may be an indication of physiologically implausible input parameter combinations or a modeling artifact. Due to inadmissible shifts of the green peak, we discarded around 5\% of the simulated \gls{S2} spectra. This is clearly lower than the number of 23\% of invalid spectra reported by~\cite{wocher_rtm-based_2020} suggesting that physiological priors reduce the amount of implausible PROSAIL spectra.

The remaining 1 nm PROSAIL outputs were resampled to the spectral response functions of S2A and S2B provided by ESA. Input parameters and simulated \gls{S2} spectra were stored in \gls{LUT}s for \gls{RTM} inversion. 

\subsection{Model Inference}
\label{subsec:model-inference}

For inference on \gls{S2} imagery, three scenarios were run: The first scenario setup uses a single \gls{RTM} parametrization for the entire growing season (NO-PHENO). In the second scenario we use AGDDs for estimating the onset of phenological stages and use the \gls{LUT} of the macro stage (AGDD-PHENO). The third scenario is essentially the same as the second but includes spatial detail from \gls{S2} pixel-based cost function values (see Section \ref{subsubsec:pheno-from-s2}) to test if differences in phenological transitions can be detected within the field parcels (AGDD-S2-PHENO).

\subsubsection{RTM Inversion}
For each \gls{S2} scene we obtained GLAI, \gls{CCC} and hence \gls{Cab} using the simulated \gls{S2} LUTs. We took the median of the $n$ best solutions in terms of the smallest cost function values between observed and simulated \gls{S2} spectra. As cost function we used the root mean squared error (RMSE) between \gls{S2} observed ($p$) and PROSAIL simulated spectra ($q$) considering all $\lambda_1, ...., \lambda_m$ spectral bands of \gls{S2} used ($m=9$, see Section \ref{subsec:rs-data}):

\begin{equation}
    RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{\lambda_i = 1}^{\lambda_m}(p(\lambda_i) - q(\lambda_i))^2}{m}}
\end{equation}

Table \ref{tab:inv-setup} shows the configurations used for the phenological phases (scenarios AGDD-PHENO and AGDD-S2-PHENO) and the NO-PHENO scenario. The configurations were obtained from systematic testing of different cost functions, \gls{LUT} sizes and number of solutions of the inversion (see Table \ref{tab:prosail-inv-settings} in Appendix). We optimized for enhancing the correlation between modeled and in-situ observed \gls{GLAI} values in terms of Pearson's R-square $R^2$.

\begin{table}[H]

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Phenology Retrieval}
\label{subsubsec:pheno-from-s2}
In the NO-PHENO scenario a single \gls{RTM} parametrization was used for all \gls{S2} scenes to derive \gls{GLAI} and CCC. In the other two scenarios we had to determine the phenological macro stage to select the appropriate \gls{LUT} for \gls{RTM} inversion. Figure \ref{fig:workflow-phenology} highlights the procedure for a hypothetical S2-derived trait time series. The red rectangles define the AGDD ranges identified from field phenotyping (Table \ref{tab:bbch-agdd}) where a switch between the phenological stages most likely occurs. In the AGDD-PHENO scenario we used the median AGDD obtained from Table \ref{tab:bbch-agdd} to switch between the phenological phases (dashed lines in Figure \ref{fig:workflow-phenology}). In the AGDD-S2-PHENO scenario we used the value of cost function of the \gls{RTM} inversion in addition. I.e., in the AGDD window of beginning of SE (BBCH31) we compared the median cost function value from inverting the \gls{LUT} for the tillering phase (GE-ET, BCCH 0-29) with the value obtained from SE-EH (BBCH 31-59). If the latter was lower, we switched from tillering into stem elongation. Otherwise the observation remained in the tillering phase until either the cost function value from stem elongation was lower or the end of the critical AGDD was reached. In that case, a switch was forced. In case no \gls{S2} scene was available we used the same procedure as in AGDD-PHENO.

\subsection{Model Validation}
\label{subsec:model-validation}

\subsubsection{On-farm trial data processing}
Independent measurements of GLAI, \gls{CCC} and BBCH were recorded at weekly to bi-weekly intervals at on-farm locations in Switzerland (see Figure \ref{fig:overview-map} and Table \ref{tab:site_characteristics}) using the methods described in Section \ref{subsec:in-situ-data-processing}. These measurements are used to test the accuracy of models calibrated on field phenotyping data applied to \gls{S2} imagery at the landscape scale (see Section \ref{subsubsec:comparison-sat-insitu}).

\subsubsection{Comparison of satellite and in-situ data}
\label{subsubsec:comparison-sat-insitu}
Modelled GLAI, \gls{CCC} and phenological macro stages were compared against on-farm validation data (see Section \ref{subsec:on-farm-trials}). We used a maximum difference of 20 GDD between in-situ sampling dates and \gls{S2} overpasses which corresponds to a maximum temporal difference of one up to a couple of days depending on the time of the year. For spatial intersection, we constructed a circle with 10 m radius around the point coordinate of the in-situ measurement. We used the mean of all \gls{S2} pixels that overlapped this circle. This is to ensure that the influence of uncertainties in the positional accuracy of both data sources is minimized.

We then calculated common error metrics including the root mean squared error (RMSE), normalized RMSE (nRMSE), normalized absolute median deviation (NMAD) and $R^2$ to compare modelled \gls{GLAI} and \gls{CCC} to in-situ samples. We treated the retrieval of the three phenological macro stages as a classification problem, i.e., a segmentation of the growing season into three stages, in which the true phenological macro stage obtained from the BBCH ratings served as target class label. We calculated the confusion matrix, the F1-score per phenological stage, i.e., per class, and an adjusted F1-score accounting for class imbalances to quantify model performance using phenological data from 2022.
For a single class classification problem, i.e., a single phenological phase, the F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision (positive predictive value) and recall (true positive rate) calculated from the number of true and false positives (tp, fp), as well as true and false negatives (tn, fn).

\begin{equation}
    precision = \frac{tp}{tp + fp}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    recall = \frac{tp}{tp + fn}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    F1\-score = \frac{2 \times precision \times recall}{precision + recall}
\end{equation}
For a multi-class classification problem as in this study, the adjusted F1-score is calculated from the F1-scores per class weighted by the number of samples per class. The adjusted F1-score is thus a measure for the overall performance of the phenological model.
Error metrics were provided for all three experimental setups to test the effect of phenological priors on \gls{RTM} inversion accuracy and determine the most accurate method for phenology estimation.

\subsection{Phenological macro stages}
\label{subsec:res-pheno-macro stages}

From a total of 970 \gls{S2} observations over the sampling points (Table \ref{tab:site_characteristics}), 134 (14\%) were located in the AGDD windows determined from phenotyping (Table \ref{tab:bbch-agdd}). The number is based on the requirement that a \gls{S2} observation must be within $\pm$20 AGDD to an in-situ observation. In the GE-ET to SE-EH transition window 23 out of 80 \gls{S2} observations could be compared to in-situ BBCH ratings. In the second window (SE-EH to FL-PM) it was 8 out of 54 observations.

The purely temperature-based AGDD-PHENO scenario predicted nearly all three stages correctly resulting in an adjusted, i.e., multi-class, F1-score of 0.96. In detail, the class-specific F1-score for GE-ET was 0.93, 0.95 for SE-EH and 1.0 for FL-PM. The confusion matrix is shown in Table \ref{tab:bbch-conf-matrix_agdd-pheno} comparing in-situ rated macro stages to model predictions. Six out of 42 observations (14\%) were wrongly assigned to the SE-EH stage by the model as can been in the confusion matrix (Table \ref{tab:bbch-conf-matrix_agdd-pheno}). For the second transition all data points were assigned to the correct phenological macro stage.

The performance of the AGDD-S2-PHENO scenario was slightly lower as shown in the confusion matrix in Table \ref{tab:bbch-conf-matrix}. This was due to an additional confusion in the second transition window of three observations. Still, the adjusted, i.e., multi-class, F1-score of the AGDD-S2-PHENO model was 0.94 as most observations were assigned correctly based on AGDDs. For the single phenological stages, the F1-score was 0.93, 0.93, and 0.96, for GE-ET, SE-EH, and FL-PM, respectively.

\subsection{Functional Trait Retrieval}
\label{subsec:res-trait-retrieval}
\subsubsection{Green Leaf Area Index}

The accuracy of \gls{GLAI} prediction increases by adding phenological priors. Figure \ref{fig:glai-val-scatter} shows scatter plots of in-situ measured \gls{GLAI} on the x-axis and \gls{GLAI} from PROSAIL inversion on the y-axis for the three scenario setups. In the baseline scenario without phenology (NO-PHENO), the RMSE is 1.15 $m^2$ $m^{-2}$ (nRMSE: 42.30\%) and the NMAD is 0.77 $m^2$ $m^{-2}$. The scenarios with phenology have lower errors, with the AGDD-PHENO scenario achieving slightly higher accuracy with an RMSE of 0.85 $m^2$ $m^{-2}$  (nRMSE 31.25\%, NMAD 0.09 $m^2$ $m^{-2}$ ) than AGDD-S2-PHENO, where the RMSE is 0.87 $m^2$ $m^{-2}$ (nRMSE 31.89\%, NMAD 0.08 $m^2$ $m^{-2}$ ). In all three cases, modeled \gls{GLAI} was able to explain between 77 (NO-PHENO) and 84\% (AGDD-PHENO and AGDD-S2-PHENO) of the variance in the in-situ data.

The higher overall accuracy is mainly due to the first phenological phase (GE-ET), in which the RMSE decreases from 0.6 $m^2$ $m^{-2}$ (nRMSE 217.52\%) in the case of NO-PHENO to 0.16 $m^2$ $m^{-2}$ (nRMSE: 58.04\%) in the AGDD-PHENO setup (N=42). We assume the increase in retrieval accuracy was mainly due to optimization in the inversion setup (see Table \ref{tab:inv-setup}): When using a larger \gls{LUT} and a higher number of solutions, the retrieval error increased to > 100\%. The ill-posedness of \gls{RTM} inversion, however, makes it difficult to make a conclusive statement. Without optimizing the inversion setup, the retrieval error was up 100\%. In the SE-EH macro stage, the NO-PHENO scenario is slightly better than the AGDD-PHENO scenario with an RMSE of 0.88 $m^2$ $m^{-2}$ and 0.95 $m^2$ $m^{-2}$, respectively (relative errors: 22.08\% and 23.75\%, N=67). In the last phenological macro stage, both models performed similar with an RMSE of 1.07 $m^2$ $m^{-2}$ (relative error: 23.1\%, N=39). In these two stages, the \gls{RTM} inversion setup was the same for both approaches as suggested by the systematic optimization approach.

    \label{fig:glai-val-scatter}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Canopy Chlorophyll Content}

As with GLAI, the incorporation of phenology shows an increase in the accuracy of \gls{CCC} retrieval. Unfortunately, fewer data points (N=59) are available for validation of CCC. Also, these are limited to the early growth stages (GE-ET and SE-EH). Figure \ref{fig:ccc-val-scatter} shows the in-situ measured versus modeled CCC. The RMSE of \gls{CCC} retrieval is about 0.37 $g$ $m^2$ (nRMSE: 55.52\%, NMAD: 0.28 $gm^2$) in the two phenological setups versus an RMSE of 0.66 $g$ $m^2$ (nRMSE 98.62\%, NMAD: 0.86 $g$ $m^2$) in the NO-PHENO baseline. The modeled \gls{CCC} explained between 79 and 84\% of the variance in the in situ values. When looking at the 2019 data alone (N=29, see cross markers in Figure \ref{fig:ccc-val-scatter}), an extremely poor retrieval performance can be observed with an $R^2$ of around 0.02. AGDD-PHENO and AGDD-S2-PHENO (Figure \ref{fig:ccc-val-scatter}b, c) show the same retrieval accuracy as the data only includes data points for which both models agreed on the same phenological macro stage.

\subsubsection{Spatio-Temporal Considerations}

Figure \ref{fig:trait-maps-wtz} shows maps of modeled \gls{GLAI} (top row), \gls{CCC} (middle row), and \gls{Cab} (bottom row) for selected \gls{S2} scenes in 2022 for the Witzwil site (Parzelle 35) depicting all three phenological macro stages. Traits are based on the AGDD-PHENO scenario which outperformed the other two setups in terms of trait retrieval accuracy. Figure \ref{fig:trait-maps-wtz} shows the high correlation between \gls{GLAI} and \gls{CCC} when comparing them on a pixel-by-pixel basis ($R^2$ between 0.97 and 0.99, N=2604 pixels per \gls{S2} scene). The correlation between \gls{GLAI} and \gls{Cab} is more variable and shows a change over the season: for example, $R^2$ is 0.5 at the beginning of stem elongation (20220325, second column from left in Figure \ref{fig:trait-maps-wtz}) and increases to 0.91 at the last date shown (20220618, right column in Figure \ref{fig:trait-maps-wtz}). An increase of trait values starting in March (GE-ET) towards a maximum in May (FL-PM) can be observed (second column from the right in Figure \ref{fig:trait-maps-wtz}) followed by a decrease in the last \gls{S2} scene (right column in Figure \ref{fig:trait-maps-wtz}) at the onset of senescence. A clear spatial pattern is visible in the field (upper central part), which can be explained by soil subsidence and associated water logging~\citep{egli_landschaftsdynamik_2020}. The observed field heterogeneity coincides with the experience of the local farmer. The spatial patterns are similar in all three traits.

Maps for the other field parcels studied in 2022 showing the same calendar dates can be found in the Appendix (Figures \ref{fig:appendix_arb_broatefaeld_2022} - \ref{fig:appendix_sff_ruetteli_2022}). Moreover, a map of GLAI, CCC, and \gls{Cab} for April 20th, 2019 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:appendix_sff_2019} for the two field parcels at which different nitrogen treatments were applied (see Section \ref{subsec:on-farm-trials}).

The high correlation between modeled \gls{GLAI} and \gls{CCC} applies to all field parcels and \gls{S2} scenes in 2022. The correlation between \gls{GLAI} and \gls{Cab} is weaker overall. It shows a seasonal change from low correlation in tillering and beginning of stem elongation to high correlation after ear swelling (BBCH macro stage 40). In 2019, the aforementioned poor retrieval accuracy in \gls{GLAI} and \gls{CCC} resulted in lower correlation between modeled \gls{GLAI} and \gls{CCC} ($R^2$ around 0.73). This is lower than in the independent calibration dataset (see Section \ref{subsec:model-calibration} and Figure \ref{fig:lai-ccc-relationship}).

Figure \ref{fig:ts-dates-agdds} shows median \gls{GLAI} (top row), \gls{CCC} (middle row), and \gls{Cab} (lower row) trajectories derived from the AGDD-PHENO scenario for all field parcels investigated in 2022. Median trait values are plotted per \gls{S2} image acquisition date in calendar dates (Figure \ref{fig:ts-dates-agdds}, a) and AGDD (Figure \ref{fig:ts-dates-agdds}, b). For all fields, the traits follow plausible temporal patterns. \gls{GLAI} values increase steadily from $<1$ $m^2$ $m^{-2}$ at the beginning of March (GE-ET phase) and reach a maximum in early summer (4 to 5.5 $m^2$ $m^{-2}$), followed by a decline in the FL-PM phase reaching values around 1 $m^2$ $m^{-2}$ in mid and late July. \gls{CCC} closely follows the seasonal trajectory of \gls{GLAI} (Figure \ref{fig:ts-dates-agdds}, middle row). \gls{Cab} (Figure \ref{fig:ts-dates-agdds}, lower row) reveals a slightly different picture: \gls{Cab} values start to increase earlier than \gls{GLAI} and show only a slight decline towards the end of the season. This means, the same \gls{GLAI} value (e.g., 1 $m^2$ $m^{-2}$) at the start and end of the season has different \gls{Cab} levels: Lower \gls{Cab} levels (< 40 $\mu g$ $cm^{-2}$) at the beginning of the season (around AGDD 700 to 800 deg C)  and higher \gls{Cab} levels (>= 40 $\mu g$ $cm^{-2}$) during the last phenological macro stage (FL-PM, around AGDD 2200 to 2500 deg C).

By comparing calendar dates and AGDDs, some interesting observations can be made: The \gls{GLAI} of the organically managed Broatefaeld plot (Arenenberg site, see Table \ref{tab:site_characteristics}) is lower than the \gls{GLAI} of the other fields and shows a delayed increase of the \gls{GLAI} in the AGDD scale. \gls{Cab} levels, however, are similar to the other parcels. In case of Parzelle 35 (Witzwil site) there is an earlier increase of \gls{GLAI} with respect to calendar dates. However, in the AGDD scale, it can be seen that the wheat in this field lags behind the other fields except for the aforementioned Broatefaeld parcel and also requires a much higher cumulative temperature sum ($\sim$2700 deg C d) to reach maturity. The other six fields already reach this value around AGDD 2200. Notably, in the calendar view, all fields reach these low \gls{GLAI} values at almost the same time by mid of July when harvest took place (between July 15th at Broatefaeld and July 27th at Ruetteli, SwissFutureFarm).

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Phenological Macro Stages}
The AGDD-PHENO scenario based on AGDD demonstrates that the results obtained from observing the physiological changes in winter wheat in small-scale field phenotyping sites can be applied to larger agricultural systems at the landscape scale. This means that it is possible to upscale the findings. We assert that by combining physically-based models (RTMs) with prior knowledge of physiology and phenology, we are able to accurately encode the essential physical and biological principles needed for the transfer of information across space and time at the landscape scale.

Due to the dependence on temperature sums, the approach works in real-time during the season (first research question). Thanks to its simplicity the proposed approach can be easily adopted for operational usage since only basic weather station or gridded meteorological data is required. Information on exact occurrence of phenological transition, however, is not provided. Given the inherent uncertainty in S2~\citep{graf_propagating_2023} and temperature data, determining transitions with high precision (e.g., up to single days) is not considered useful as uncertainty alone might be in the range of a couple of days. Our approach also does not allow a more fine-grained view on phenology, such as the onset of tillering (BBCH 21) or booting (BBCH 41). This is, however, mainly to lack of corresponding phenological ratings. As~\citep{liao_near_2023} showed the detection of further phenological macro stages from remotely-sensed data is possible given calibration data availability.

Our approach differs substantially from previous remote sensing studies of phenology, which are mostly based on time series analyses of growing seasons that have already been completed~\citep{zeng_review_2020}. Phenology estimates in real time are therefore often not possible. In addition, we circumvent the need to fit a time series to remotely sensed data points, which is associated with large uncertainties and potential for error~\citep{younes_all_2021}. Especially in geographic regions with high annual cloud cover such as the mid-latitudes or tropical regions, fitting of time series can fail or lead to implausible estimates of phenology. Furthermore, our approach models phenology as stages with physiological significance, which is often not fully addressed in remote sensing studies and limits their interpretability as well as applicability to agriculture.

The AGDD scenarios may encounter limitations when temperature is not the main driving factor for phenological development (e.g., under water-limited conditions), or when crops are stressed in some other ways ~\citep{bonecke_decoupling_2020}. Mechanistic crop growth models might therefore be a more sophisticated and reliable alternative. Moreover, the AGDD-PHENO scenario cannot detect differences in phenology within the field as we have a single temperature reading per field. This was the motivation for adding the cost function value from the \gls{RTM} inversion (AGDD-S2-PHENO) to introduce spatial detail from remote sensing. This scenario revealed slightly lower accuracy (Table \ref{tab:bbch-conf-matrix}). Still, due to the small number ($N=31$) of \gls{S2} observations with corresponding in-situ BBCH ratings at the critical AGDD windows (see Section \ref{subsec:res-pheno-macro stages}), it is difficult to make conclusive assessments. Arguably, canopy structure might only change gradually during the transition from one phenological stage to the other and so might the influence on the spectral properties. Consequently, slight uncertainties in determining the phenological stage will have limited effect on the trait retrieval. As ~\cite{liao_near_2023} showed that spectral information from \gls{S2} data can indeed be used to reveal spatial differences in phenological macro stages within wheat fields, we still see great potential in this approach. However, a more conclusive metric than the value of the cost function of the \gls{RTM} inversion needs to be found.

The AGDD windows based on multi-year field phenotyping and a large number of genotypes are valid for Swiss conditions and those of neighboring western and central European countries due to European GABI wheat panel (see Section \ref{subsubsec:fip-data}) and similar environmental conditions in terms of climate and soils. It should be noted that breeding progress, for example towards climate-resilient varieties, may require recalibration in the future. On the example of wheat cultivars in Western Germany between 1952 and 2013, ~\cite{rezaei_climate_2018} showed that historical changes in wheat phenology are mainly due to breeding progress, as modern cultivars require a lower temperature sum to reach flowering. However, this is only feasible if sufficient data from field phenotyping from multiple years and geographic locations is available. The same applies regarding the transferability of our approach to other important crops such as maize or soybean or future climate conditions.

\subsection{Functional Trait Retrieval}
The usage of field phenotyping data improved RTM-based functional trait retrieval (second research question). 

\subsubsection{Retrieval Accuracy}
Seasonal trajectories of GLAI, CCC, and \gls{Cab} showed meaningful patterns (Figure \ref{fig:ts-dates-agdds}) and reflected large-scale field heterogeneity (Figure \ref{fig:trait-maps-wtz}). The use of thermal time as a complement to calendar dates also creates the basis for making plant growth and phenology comparable in space and time, since temperature sums represent a common frame of reference. In the 2019 N-experiment, in which field heterogeneity was artificially increased the models showed poor performance and were not able to resolve small-scale field heterogeneity. We attribute this issue to two main causes: First, the plot design of the experiment might still be too small compared to the spatial resolution of \gls{S2} (see Section \ref{subsec:on-farm-trials}). Second, the GLAI-CCC relationship (see Figure \ref{fig:lai-ccc-relationship}) used as physiological prior to calibrate the models was not obtained under field conditions under which small-scale heterogeneity was exaggerated artificially. Thus, more calibration data might be required to enable a more accurate retrieval of \gls{CCC} under variable field management conditions.

The relationship between \gls{GLAI} and \gls{Cab} shows decoupling at early growth stages (see Figures \ref{fig:trait-maps-wtz} and \ref{fig:ts-dates-agdds}). This is plausible, since large fluctuations in \gls{Cab} are to be expected at low biomass values in the vegetative phase \citep{lemaire_diagnosis_2008}. The same applies to the senescence phase (BBCH > 90). For senescence, unfortunately, we have no validation data (see Section \ref{subsec:model-validation}) and only few calibration data, since the distinction between green and brown, i.e., photosynthetically inactive, LAI is a highly subjective task. Therefore, further calibration and validation data are needed to model and validate senescence.

It is also important to consider that the inversion result arises from the aggregation of several solutions, using the entire spectral information. This can cause variations in the chlorophyll content to disappear: First, the inversion is more sensitive to changes in GLAI, as \gls{GLAI} - unlike chlorophyll - affects all spectral bands~\citep{verrelst_global_2017}. Second, the aggregation by using the median of the $n$ best solutions might suppress small leaf chlorophyll variations similarly to noise.

Generally, the retrieval accuracy of functional traits is between values found in studies using \gls{S2} data and PROSAIL simulations: For example, ~\cite{xie_retrieval_2019} obtained an RMSE in \gls{GLAI} of 1.53 $m^2m^{-2}$ for winter wheat, while ~\cite{pan_modeling_2019} reported an RMSE of 0.43 $m^2m^{-2}$ (nRMSE: 11\%), both in Northern China. Using a multi-year dataset obtained on wheat fields in Belgium, ~\cite{delloye_retrieval_2018} reported RMSE about 0.7 $m^2m^{-2}$ (nRMSE: 35.86\%) when using the \gls{S2} red-edge bands for \gls{RTM} inversion, which was similar to the error we obtained from all bands (RMSE: 0.72 $m^2m^{-2}$). For CCC, an error of 0.35 $gm^{-2}$ was obtained from all \gls{S2} bands resulting in a relative error of 26.37\%. In a multi-crop approach on winter wheat and maize in Southern Germany ~\cite{estevez_top--atmosphere_2021} reported an RMSE of 0.48 $m^2m^{-2}$ (nRMSE: 12.94\%) in \gls{GLAI} and of 0.39 $gm^{-2}$ in \gls{CCC} (nRMSE: 18.14\%). However, their sample size is small (N=14) and only includes three winter wheat samples.

Notably, none of the aforementioned studies used physiological or phenological priors from field phenotyping as suggested in this study. One might therefore conclude that similar retrieval accuracy can be achieved without the explicit usage of field phenotyping data. However, only in few studies, e.g., by~\cite{delloye_retrieval_2018}, \gls{GLAI} and \gls{CCC} were derived simultaneously, making direct comparisons to our work difficult. Moreover, only in few cases have the data used been disclosed, so we could not directly compare our method with those of other authors.

Our findings regarding trait retrieval accuracy might also mean that one-dimensional \gls{RTM}s such as PROSAIL building on the turbid medium assumption~\citep{verhoef_light_1984} have reached their accuracy limit. Turbid medium \gls{RTM}s represent a canopy as a single layer with absorbing and scattering particles dissolved uniformly in it. Thus, the alignment of leaves in vertically-structured layers with different optical properties found in winter wheat cannot be fully represented~\citep{zhao_effect_2017}. Significant changes in trait retrieval accuracy might only be possible using more sophisticated models, such as \gls{RTM}s with multiple leaf layers~\citep{verhoef_coupled_2007} or three-dimensional RTMs~\citep{jiang_effective_2022}. To do so, the incorporation of further structural and morphological traits such as leaf angles or the vertical distribution of leaves in plants from field phenotyping might be beneficial. Advancing the development of \gls{RTM}s towards a higher degree of morphological and physiological plausibility were, however, beyond the scope of this study.

\subsubsection{The role of phenology}

The incorporation of phenology increased trait retrieval accuracy. This is especially due to the possibility to optimize the \gls{RTM} inversion setup for the individual stages, i.e., to optimize the size of the LUT, number of solutions and choice of cost function per phenological macro stage. Our experiments suggest that optimizing the inversion configuration has a greater influence than the actual phenological priors (see Section \ref{subsec:res-trait-retrieval}). These findings are consistent with previous studies about \gls{RTM} inversion, e.g., by ~\cite{verrelst_optimizing_2014}. Moreover, it seems conceivable to adjust the selection of spectral channels per phenological stage, since the sensitivity of spectral channels to \gls{GLAI} and \gls{CCC} depends on the phenological developmental stage: For instance, at low LAI values, the sensitivity to a leaf trait such as \gls{Cab} is weak ~\citep{verhoef_hyperspectral_2018}.

Furthermore, our approach allows to consider different traits per phenological macro stage or to parameterize them with greater attention. This is possible because the macro stages represent important physiological transitions in winter wheat, in which different traits are important to study. For example, during the first stage (GE-ET), green canopy cover is a trait of great relevance. Canopy cover is used to quantify, e.g., the interception of radiation~\citep{steven_foliage_1986} or to determine the risk of soil erosion by water~\citep{gabriels_assessment_2003}. Thus, in further research, this trait could be modeled for this phenological macro stage.

\subsubsection{An up-scaling problem?}

The strength of the linear relationship between modeled \gls{GLAI} and \gls{CCC} is either higher (2022 data, Figure \ref{fig:trait-maps-wtz}) or lower (2019) than suggested by the multi-year phenotyping data (Figure \ref{fig:lai-ccc-relationship}). Seemingly, the remotely sensed GLAI-CCC relationship is over-simplified. This reveals a fundamental problem in the derivation of \gls{CCC} from \gls{S2} imagery. While \gls{CCC} is conceptually a canopy trait, it is directly related to leaf chlorophyll and thus to the leaf scale. Therefore, in-situ measurement and RTM-based estimation of \gls{CCC} always requires up-scaling, since only the leaf trait can be measured or modeled. In addition, for both in-situ and \gls{RTM} \gls{CCC} determination, it is assumed that chlorophyll is distributed uniformly in the canopy. This assumption ignores that chlorophyll content tends to decrease from the top of the canopy towards the ground due to vertical distribution of leaves in wheat ~\citep{huang_estimation_2011} - which again might call for more complex RTMs.

There is also the question of an appropriate scheme for in-situ sampling of a leaf trait (Cab) for up-scaling to the canopy (i.e., CCC). If only leaves from the upper leaf level are taken, this might intuitively come closer to what the satellite sees, which ultimately measures the top-of-canopy reflectance. However, this is not representative of the entirety of the canopy as previously explained. Moreover, since the entire canopy contributes to the total reflectance~\citep{kuusk_markov_1995, wang_canopy_2013, dodorico_vertical_2018}, albeit decreasing with distance from the canopy surface, an in-situ leaf sample should also include leaves from lower tiers. Arguably, this topic deserves more attention and should be addressed by further research.

\subsection{Advancing agricultural remote sensing}

By using priors from field phenotyping such as correlations between traits (see Section \ref{subsec:model-calibration}) and concepts such as growing degree days or the BBCH scale our results are physiologically sound, physically-based and can be interpreted by agronomist and stakeholders in agriculture. In-season crop assessment on large scale plays a crucial role in global food security by providing early warning systems~\citep{becker-reshef_strengthening_2020}. The approach presented can be integrated into existing process-based crop growth models in many of which \gls{GLAI} is a key state variable~\citep{delecolle_remote_1992}. Further, improved assessment of crop growth can be used on a local scale by practitioners. Many precision farming applications rely on remotely sensed data to, e.g., determine the plant fertilization demand~\citep{argento_site-specific_2021,argento_investigating_2022}. Thus, improving the plant trait retrieval arguably enhances the accuracy and efficiency of precision agriculture tools. With our approach, we mitigate overcome shortcomings identified in the remote sensing literature by adding a tool to the toolbox of remote sensing that offers improvement of data and enhanced interpretability. This opens opportunities for further interdisciplinary research and will arguably advance agricultural remote sensing. 

Again, our approach is arguably simple and requires only basic weather station data. Thus, it is suited for operational usage and can be applied on large spatial scales. In the same way, our approach could be transferred to other crops given that field phenotyping data is available to constrain the modeling of growth and phenology. Further research could address enhancements in RTMs, and focus on more advanced modeling of crop growth and phenology, e.g., by including dose-response relationships~\citep{roth_phenomics_2021,roth_phenomics_2022} and process-based crop models.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:insights_conclusions}
% \input{Conclusions.tex}
Bringing together field phenotyping and remote sensing opens unprecedented opportunities to deepen our understanding of crop growth and development.
We showed that insights from field phenotyping can be used to monitor winter wheat growth and phenological macro stages on the landscape scale by \gls{RTM} inversion on \gls{S2} imagery. The proposed approach works in near real-time and thus meets the requirements for many agricultural applications, such as fertilizer and pesticide scheduling. The use of phenological and physiological priors using multi-year field phenotyping data improved RTM-based trait retrieval accuracy and paves the way for improving \gls{RTM} parametrization and the selection of traits according to physiological considerations and environmental covariates. In terms of phenological macro stages, we demonstrated that accumulated temperature sums from field phenotyping experiments could be used to identify the three main phenological macro stages in wheat using \gls{S2} imagery. These macro stages have a physiological meaning and are therefore an improvement compared to many previous remote sensing attempts to phenology. Our work enables physiologically sound comparisons between sites and wheat cultivars which is important to study plant-environment interactions at the landscape scale.

Further research should address open points regarding the up-scaling of leaf traits to the canopy and the collection of further calibration and validation data. In addition, more attention should be paid to a more fine-grained view on phenology. Furthermore, phenological stages for which little data are currently available such as senescence should be studied in greater detail. We also see a need for more advanced canopy RTMs, which should account for vertical and horizontal gradients in canopies in terms of leaf distribution and morphology.
